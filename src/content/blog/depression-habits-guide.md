You know the cycle. You have a good week—maybe the medication is working, maybe you just caught a break—and you start doing things. You shower daily, you cook real meals, you go for walks. You think maybe this time it's different. Then the depression comes back like a wave, and within three days you're back in bed, the dishes are piled up, and you haven't brushed your teeth in you're not sure how long. Every habit you built dissolves the moment your brain chemistry shifts.

You're not failing at habits because you lack discipline. You're failing because every habit guide is written for people whose brains work consistently, and yours doesn't. Depression creates a moving target—what's possible on a good day is impossible on a bad day, and there's no way to predict which day you'll wake up to.

Here's how to actually do it.

**Habits fail during depression because they're designed for stable brain chemistry, not for brains that alternate between "barely functioning" and "somewhat functional."**

## Why Building Habits During Depression Feels So Hard

Depression fundamentally breaks the mechanisms that habits rely on. Normal habit formation assumes you have baseline access to: motivation, decision-making capacity, physical energy, emotional regulation, and the ability to imagine a future where things matter. Depression strips away all of these intermittently and unpredictably.

The standard habit advice—"do it every day at the same time," "never break the streak," "start small and build up"—assumes tomorrow-you will have roughly the same capacity as today-you. But with depression, tomorrow-you might have 10% of today's capacity. You can't build habits on consistency when your brain chemistry isn't consistent.

There's also the motivation paradox that nobody talks about. The habits that would most help depression (exercise, healthy eating, social connection, sleep routine) are the exact habits that depression makes impossible. Depression tells you these things don't matter and won't help, and then makes doing them feel like climbing a mountain in quicksand. You need the habits to fight the depression, but you need to fight the depression to build the habits. It's a circular trap.

The other hidden problem is shame compounding. When you can't maintain a habit, you feel like a failure. The shame makes the depression worse. The worse depression makes the habit harder. You end up in a spiral where every broken habit is evidence that you're broken, which makes it even harder to try again. Most people with depression have a mental graveyard of failed habit attempts, each one adding to the belief that "I just can't do this."

### The mistake most guides make

Standard habit advice tells you to make the habit so easy you can't say no. "Just do one pushup!" "Just write one sentence!" This might work for people who are procrastinating. It doesn't work for people whose brain is actively lying to them about whether getting out of bed is worth the effort. On a severe depression day, one pushup isn't easy—it's impossible.

The advice also assumes that completing the habit will make you feel good, which will reinforce the behavior. But depression breaks your reward system. You can complete the habit and feel nothing, or worse, feel angry that you wasted energy on something pointless. The dopamine hit that normally reinforces habits doesn't happen, so the habit doesn't stick.

The final mistake is treating depression as a temporary obstacle to work around rather than a permanent feature to design for. "Do your habits on good days, be gentle with yourself on bad days" sounds nice but creates a habit that only exists part-time. You need habits that work on bad days, not habits that you do when you're already feeling okay.

## What You'll Need

**Time investment**: 
- Week 1: 20 minutes to set up + 5 minutes per day
- Week 2-4: 10-15 minutes per day
- Month 2+: 15-25 minutes per day (but becomes automatic even on low days)

**Upfront cost**: 
- Free version: $0 (uses items you own, paper tracking, existing spaces)
- Budget version: $10-30 (basic supplies to make habits easier, simple tools)
- Optimized version: $50-150 (supports that significantly reduce friction, backup systems)

**Prerequisites**: 
- Currently stable enough to read this and implement one small thing
- Access to basic survival resources (safe place to sleep, some food)
- Ability to distinguish between low-functioning days and crisis days
- Acceptance that perfection is not the goal—survival is

**Won't work if**: 
- You're in acute crisis requiring immediate intervention (suicidal ideation, complete inability to function—please call 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- You're currently unhoused or in an unsafe environment (safety needs come first)
- You have untreated substance dependency that needs medical detox
- You're in the middle of medication changes causing severe instability (wait 2-3 weeks for adjustment)

## The Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1: Days 1-7)

**Step 1: Identify your depression floor**

- What to do: Think about your worst depression days in the last month—the days where you could barely function. Write down what you were actually able to do on those days. Not what you wish you could do, what you actually did. Examples: "stayed in bed but managed to drink water," "got to the bathroom," "ate crackers," "scrolled phone." This is your floor. This is the absolute minimum your brain can execute when depression is winning. Write these things down as your Floor Actions. These are not your habits—they're your baseline for building habits.

- Why it matters: You cannot build habits below your floor. If your floor is "can get out of bed to use bathroom," then any habit that requires leaving the house is not going to work on floor days. Most people try to build habits based on their good days, which means the habits immediately fail when they hit their floor. You need to know your floor so you can build habits that work at that level. Everything else is bonus.

- Common mistake: Lying about your floor because it feels shameful. "I should be able to shower every day" is irrelevant. What can you actually do on a day when depression is severe? Be ruthlessly honest. Also mistaking a crisis day for your floor—if you literally couldn't get out of bed at all, that's crisis, not floor. Your floor is the worst you function when not in active crisis.

- Quick check: On your worst day last month, could you have done each thing you listed? If you're not sure, your floor is too optimistic. Make it smaller.

**Step 2: Choose one survival habit, not an improvement habit**

- What to do: Pick ONE habit that serves basic survival or prevents things from getting worse. This is not about getting better—it's about not deteriorating. Examples: drinking one glass of water per day, taking meds (if prescribed), eating one meal, getting outside for 2 minutes, brushing teeth once. Not exercise, not meditation, not journaling about feelings. Pick the one thing that, if you don't do it, makes tomorrow worse. Write it down: "My survival habit is: [ONE THING]."

- Why it matters: Improvement habits require energy you don't have during depression. They also require believing the future matters, which depression actively prevents. Survival habits bypass this because they're about today, not tomorrow. You're not doing it to feel better eventually—you're doing it so you don't feel worse now. This reframing is critical. Also, one habit only. Depression loves to make you feel overwhelmed. One thing is manageable. Three things is a setup for failure.

- Common mistake: Choosing a habit you think you "should" do or that sounds impressive. This needs to be purely functional. If you pick exercise because "it's good for depression," you'll fail. If you pick "take my medication" because without it tomorrow is definitely worse, you'll succeed. Also picking multiple habits because one seems too small—one is the point.

- Quick check: Could you explain why this habit prevents deterioration rather than creates improvement? If the benefit is in the future (weeks or months), it's the wrong habit. The benefit needs to be immediate or next-day.

**Step 3: Make the habit smaller than seems reasonable**

- What to do: Take your survival habit and make it absurdly small—small enough that you could do it on a floor day. If your habit is "drink water," make it "drink 4 ounces of water" (quarter of a glass). If it's "eat one meal," make it "eat three bites of any food." If it's "brush teeth," make it "brush front teeth only for 30 seconds." If it's "go outside," make it "stand outside door for 30 seconds." Write down this minimal version as your Floor Version.

- Why it matters: On good days, you'll do more than the floor version—that's fine. But the floor version is what counts for maintaining the streak. If the minimum is too high, you'll skip it on bad days, break the streak, feel shame, and abandon the habit entirely. The floor version needs to be so small that even depression brain can't argue it's impossible. You're not being weak by making it tiny—you're being strategic.

- Common mistake: Making the floor version still require too many steps. "Drink a glass of water" requires getting up, going to kitchen, getting glass, filling it, drinking it. If you're in bed and can't get up, that's 5 steps you can't do. Better floor version: "drink from the water bottle I keep next to my bed." One step. Also feeling embarrassed that the habit is so small—nobody else needs to know. This is for you.

- Quick check: On the worst day you described in Step 1, could you have done this floor version without getting out of bed or opening a drawer? If not, make it smaller or remove obstacles.

**Checkpoint**: By day 7, you should know your depression floor, chosen one survival habit, and created a floor version of it that's embarrassingly small. You should have attempted the floor version at least 3 days, even if you only completed it once or twice. You're not aiming for perfection—you're aiming for proof that the floor version is possible.

### Phase 2: Building the System (Week 2-4: Days 8-28)

**Step 1: Create pre-positioned supplies**

- What to do: Identify every supply needed for your survival habit and put duplicates in the exact locations where you might need them. If your habit is taking medication: pills next to bed, pills in bathroom, pills in kitchen. If it's drinking water: water bottle next to bed, glass in every room you spend time in. If it's eating something: non-perishable food next to bed, in your bag, in your car. If it's brushing teeth: toothbrush and toothpaste in bathroom AND a spare set in your bedroom. Remove every possible step between "thinking about doing the habit" and "doing the habit."

- Why it matters: Depression makes every step feel impossible. Getting up to get something is often the step that kills the habit. If the supplies are already where you are, you eliminate the main barrier. This is not laziness—this is accommodation for a disability. People with physical disabilities use mobility aids; people with depression use pre-positioned supplies. Both are necessary adaptations.

- Common mistake: Thinking you'll "just get it" when you need it. You won't. Depression brain will use any obstacle as justification to skip the habit. Also buying expensive duplicates—dollar store versions work fine. A $1 toothbrush next to your bed is infinitely better than a $15 toothbrush in the bathroom you can't get to.

- Quick check: From your bed right now, could you do your floor version of your habit without standing up? If not, add supplies.

**Step 2: Build the visual streak system**

- What to do: Get a wall calendar or print a blank month grid. Put it somewhere you see from your bed. Every day you do your floor version of your habit (not the expanded version, the floor version), mark the day. Use a marker, sticker, or just an X. The only rule: floor version counts. If all you did was the floor version, that's a successful day. If you did more, great, but it doesn't count for more. Binary success only.

- Why it matters: Depression destroys your sense of time and progress. You feel like you never do anything and nothing ever gets better. The visual streak proves this is a lie. You can see the X's from bed on days when you can't remember doing anything. Also, the streak becomes weirdly compelling—after 4-5 days, you'll have a tiny bit of motivation to not break it. Not enough to overcome severe depression, but enough to tip the scales on medium-bad days.

- Common mistake: Making the tracking system complicated (apps with multiple data points, detailed journals). Complex tracking requires energy you don't have. One mark per day, binary success, visible from bed. That's it. Also only counting "good" execution—if you did the floor version at 11:59pm while crying, it counts. Completion is completion.

- Quick check: Can you see your tracking calendar from your bed? Can you mark it without getting up? If no, move it closer or switch to a method you can access (some people keep the calendar on their nightstand).

**Step 3: Create the crisis protocol**

- What to do: Write down what to do on days when even the floor version feels impossible. Not "try harder" or "push through"—an actual protocol. Example protocol: "If I can't do floor version today: (1) I don't do it, (2) I don't mark the calendar, (3) I forgive myself out loud ('Depression is hard, I'm doing my best'), (4) I restart tomorrow, no penalty." Put this protocol where you can see it from bed. Some people put it on an index card taped to their wall or saved as a phone photo.

- Why it matters: The crisis protocol prevents the shame spiral that kills habits. When you skip a day and have no protocol, your brain tells you you've failed and might as well give up. The protocol says "this is expected, here's what we do." It normalizes the skip. It removes the decision-making (you just follow the protocol). Most importantly, it includes the restart instruction, which is what keeps habits alive long-term during depression.

- Common mistake: Not making a protocol because you hope you won't need it. You will need it. Depression guarantees you will have days where the floor version is still too much. Planning for it removes the panic when it happens. Also making the protocol complicated or punitive—it should be maximum 4 steps and zero punishment.

- Quick check: Does your protocol include explicit permission to skip without shame? Does it include the instruction to restart tomorrow? If missing either, revise.

**Step 4: Add the bad-day anchor**

- What to do: Pick an existing thing that happens every day even on floor days. Examples: waking up (even if you stay in bed), first time using the bathroom, first time you check your phone, taking your antidepressant (if prescribed), someone else waking you/checking on you. This becomes your anchor. Your survival habit happens immediately after this anchor, or as close as possible. Write it down: "After [ANCHOR], I do [FLOOR VERSION OF HABIT]."

- Why it matters: Habits require triggers. But most triggers don't happen on depression days ("after my morning workout" doesn't work when you can't work out). You need a trigger that happens even when you're at your floor. By anchoring to something guaranteed, you create a reliable cue. The anchor also removes the decision of "when should I do this today?" The answer is always "after the anchor."

- Common mistake: Picking an anchor that requires getting out of bed if your floor is staying in bed most of the day. Your anchor needs to be reliable even at your absolute worst. Also picking an anchor that happens at different times (like "after I eat" when you don't eat consistently)—time-of-day anchors work better for depression than event anchors.

- Quick check: Did your anchor happen yesterday? The day before? Would it happen even on a crisis day? If you can't confidently say yes to all three, pick a different anchor.

**What to expect**: Week 2 feels hard because you're implementing new systems while still functioning poorly. That's normal. Week 3 is usually when you'll hit your first real test—a floor day where you use the crisis protocol. How you handle that day determines whether the habit survives. Week 4 is where you start seeing the streak build and noticing that the habit is starting to happen automatically, even on medium-bad days.

**Don't panic if**: You use the crisis protocol multiple times this phase. Some people need it 3-4 times in a month. That's fine—the protocol exists for this. Also don't panic if the streak never gets longer than 4-5 days before breaking. Short streaks that restart are better than no habit at all. Also don't panic if doing the habit doesn't make you feel better. It's not supposed to make you feel better—it's supposed to prevent worse.

### Phase 3: Expansion (Month 2+: After Day 30)

**Step 1: Evaluate whether to expand or maintain**

- What to do: Look at your streak calendar. If you've completed your floor version at least 20 out of the last 30 days (67%), you can consider expansion. If not, maintain the current habit for another month—there's no timeline. To evaluate expansion: On the days you had more capacity, did you naturally do more than the floor version? If yes, that's your signal to formalize a middle tier. If no, stay at floor version—it's working.

- Why it matters: Expansion needs to be driven by your actual pattern, not by what you think you "should" be doing by now. Some people maintain floor-version-only habits for months or years because their depression doesn't give them many high-capacity days. That's success, not stagnation. Other people naturally start extending the habit on good days and need a middle tier to formalize that without abandoning the floor tier.

- Common mistake: Expanding because you feel like you should be doing more by now, not because you're actually ready. If you're still using the crisis protocol more than twice a month, you're not ready to expand. Also expanding by removing the floor version—never remove the floor version. You're adding a tier, not replacing.

- Quick check: Can you identify a middle tier that you've actually done at least 5 times in the last month? If not, you're not ready to expand.

**Step 2: Create the three-tier system**

- What to do: You now formalize three versions of your habit. Floor (what you've been doing), Middle (a step up that's achievable on medium days), and Full (what you do on good days). Example for "take medication": Floor = take meds only, Middle = take meds + drink full glass of water, Full = take meds + water + vitamins + write down any side effects. Example for "eat something": Floor = three bites of anything, Middle = one complete small meal, Full = balanced meal + sitting at table. Write all three versions clearly where you can see them.

- Why it matters: The three-tier system matches your habit to your capacity on any given day. You're not succeeding or failing—you're calibrating. On floor days, floor version. On medium days, middle version. On good days, full version. All three count as maintaining the streak. This removes the all-or-nothing thinking that kills habits during depression. You always have a version you can do.

- Common mistake: Making the tiers too close together or too far apart. Floor to middle should be a noticeable but achievable jump. Middle to full should feel satisfying but not overwhelming. Also making the full version so ambitious that you rarely do it—the full version should happen at least once a week on average, or it's not calibrated to your actual capacity.

- Quick check: Could you explain the difference between your three tiers to someone in one sentence each? If they're confusing even to you, simplify them.

**Step 3: Add the companion habit (optional)**

- What to do: Only if your primary survival habit is solid (20+ days per month for 2+ months), consider adding one companion habit that pairs naturally with it. Example: if your survival habit is "take meds," companion might be "take vitamins at same time." If survival habit is "drink water," companion might be "eat something with the water." The companion habit uses the same anchor and happens in the same moment. It's not a separate second habit—it's an extension of the first.

- Why it matters: Building a second standalone habit during depression is often too much. But adding a companion habit to an existing strong habit leverages the momentum you already have. You're already doing the thing; you're just doing slightly more while you're there. This works because the decision-making and activation energy are already spent on the primary habit.

- Common mistake: Adding a companion habit before the primary habit is truly solid. If you're still skipping your primary habit regularly, you're not ready. Also adding a companion that requires different supplies or locations—it needs to happen in the same place at the same time, or it's not truly a companion.

- Quick check: Could you do your primary habit and companion habit in a combined total time of under 3 minutes? If it's taking longer, the companion is too complex.

**Signs it's working**: 
- You're completing the floor version 4-5 days per week minimum, even during depression episodes
- You've used the crisis protocol and successfully restarted after using it
- The habit happens somewhat automatically—you do it without deliberating first
- On your good days, you naturally do more than the floor version without it feeling forced

**Red flags**: 
- You're regularly going 7+ days without completing even the floor version (the floor is too high)
- You haven't restarted after using the crisis protocol—you just stopped (shame is winning)
- You're doing the habit but it's making you more anxious or depressed (wrong habit choice)
- You've expanded to multiple habits and none of them are working (you overextended)

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Severe depression with frequent floor days

**Context**: 34-year-old with major depressive disorder, medicated but still has severe episodes lasting weeks. Would go days without eating, weeks without showering. Previous habit attempts all failed within days because they required "normal person" capacity she didn't have.

**How they adapted it**: Survival habit was "eat something." Floor version was brutally simple: eat three bites of anything within arm's reach of the bed. She kept granola bars, crackers, and protein bars on her nightstand at all times. Anchor was "first time I pick up my phone in the morning" (which always happened, even on floor days). Crisis protocol: if she couldn't even eat three bites, she'd drink a nutrition shake instead (also on nightstand), and that counted. Middle version (on medium days): eat a piece of toast in bed. Full version (on good days): eat a meal in the kitchen. The streak calendar was on her wall visible from bed. She marked it while still lying down. First month, she completed floor or crisis version 18 days. Second month, 23 days. Third month, 25 days, including some middle and full versions. The habit survived two major depressive episodes.

**Result**: After 6 months, eating something every day had become automatic enough that she went from "I might not eat for 2-3 days" to "I always eat something, even if it's tiny." She added a companion habit in month 7: taking vitamins with the food. Still had terrible days, still used crisis protocol monthly, but the habit survived. Most importantly, maintaining this one tiny habit made her feel slightly less hopeless because it proved she could do something, even when depression was bad.

### Example 2: Depression with unpredictable crashes

**Context**: 27-year-old with depression and anxiety, would have weeks where they functioned okay followed by sudden crashes into barely-functional mode. Couldn't predict when crashes would hit. Every habit they'd tried worked until a crash, then disappeared forever.

**How they adapted it**: Survival habit was "take medication." Floor version was take the pill, period. They set up a pill system: pills in a weekly organizer next to bed, duplicate organizer in bathroom, spare bottle in kitchen. Anchor was "when my 9am phone alarm goes off" (alarm goes off even if they don't get up). If they took the pill in bed and went back to sleep, it counted. Crisis protocol was used when they couldn't even take the pill (which happened 2-3 times per month during crashes)—protocol was drink water, forgive themselves, restart tomorrow. Middle version: take pill + drink full glass of water + note any side effects in phone. Full version: take pill + water + eat breakfast + review the day's commitments. The three-tier system meant crashes didn't kill the habit—they just dropped to floor version.

**Result**: First three months, they used floor version 40% of days, middle version 35%, full version 15%, crisis protocol (skip) 10%. This was the first habit that survived multiple crashes. The visual streak showed them that even during their worst month, they took medication 21 out of 30 days—compared to before the system when crashes meant they'd stop meds entirely for weeks. After 6 months, medication compliance improved enough that their doctor noticed and asked what changed.

### Example 3: Depression with executive dysfunction and ADHD

**Context**: 31-year-old with depression and ADHD. Executive dysfunction meant even simple tasks felt impossible to start. Had tried habit apps, reminders, accountability partners—everything failed because the initiation problem was too severe. Would know they needed to do something and be completely unable to make themselves start.

**How they adapted it**: Survival habit was "go outside for 30 seconds." This was chosen specifically because getting outside even briefly helped their mood slightly and helped with sleep. Floor version: open door, stand outside for 30 seconds, come back in. They solved the initiation problem by attaching the habit to something that already overcame executive dysfunction: letting their dog out to pee (which happened every morning because the dog demanded it). When dog went out, they went out too. The dog was the external forcing function. Crisis protocol: if they couldn't go outside, they sat by the window with it open for 1 minute and counted that. Middle version: walk around the yard while dog pees. Full version: 5-minute walk around the block. They also added a sensory reward (smelling coffee beans) immediately after, kept in a container next to the door.

**Result**: The dog-as-anchor worked because it bypassed their executive dysfunction—the dog was going out regardless, they just had to follow. First month: 24 days completion. The habit survived because it required zero initiation on their part. In month 4, they added a companion habit: watering one plant while outside. Still struggled with executive dysfunction on most tasks, but this habit was embedded in a system that didn't require functioning executive control.

## Common Problems and Fixes

### Problem: "I keep breaking the streak and giving up entirely"

**Why it happens**: You're treating broken streaks as failure instead of as expected part of depression management. Your brain is using the break as evidence that you're broken. Also, you probably don't have a clear restart protocol.

**Quick fix**: Write the crisis protocol on an index card and tape it where you'll see it. When you break the streak tomorrow (and you will, because depression guarantees it), read the protocol out loud, follow it exactly, and restart. Breaking streaks is not failure—failing to restart is failure.

**Long-term solution**: Reframe what streaks mean. A streak during depression is not "days without breaking." It's "times I restarted after breaking." Count your restarts. After 10 restarts, you've proven the habit is real. The streak length matters less than the restart count. Also examine if your floor version is actually at your floor—if you're breaking constantly, the floor is too high.

### Problem: "The habit doesn't make me feel any better so it feels pointless"

**Why it happens**: You're expecting the habit to fix your depression. It won't. Depression isn't fixed by habits—it's managed by medication, therapy, time, and support. The habit is just preventing additional deterioration.

**Quick fix**: Change your success metric. Instead of "did this make me feel better," ask "did skipping this make tomorrow worse?" If taking your meds doesn't make you happy but skipping them makes you more depressed, the habit is working. Success is preventing worse, not creating better.

**Long-term solution**: Separate maintenance from improvement. Survival habits maintain baseline functioning. Improvement comes from treatment (therapy, medication adjustments, life changes). You need both, but they're different. If you want to feel better, work with your doctor on treatment. If you want to prevent deterioration, maintain your survival habits. They serve different purposes.

### Problem: "I'm functional enough that the floor version feels like I'm not trying"

**Why it happens**: You're experiencing a good period and your brain is telling you that you should be doing more, that the floor version is for "really depressed" people and you're not that bad right now. This is a trap.

**Quick fix**: Keep doing the floor version on good days anyway. You're allowed to do more (that's what the middle and full versions are for), but the floor version stays in your routine. Think of it as practice for the next floor day, which is coming whether you like it or not.

**Long-term solution**: Recognize this thought pattern as part of depression's cycle. Depression makes you think "I'm fine now, I don't need this" during good periods, which is why everything collapses when the bad period returns. The floor version is insurance. You keep it even when you don't need it, because you will need it. Never remove the floor version, regardless of how long you've been functional.

### Problem: "I can do this habit but I can't do anything else so I still feel like I'm failing at life"

**Why it happens**: You're comparing your one survival habit to everything you think you should be doing. The gap between "I brushed my teeth" and "I went to work, cooked dinner, exercised, and socialized" feels enormous, so the one habit feels meaningless.

**Quick fix**: List everything you didn't do today that you wish you had done. Now look at your one survival habit. That habit prevented any of those other things from being harder tomorrow. You took your meds, so tomorrow you won't also be dealing with medication withdrawal. You ate something, so tomorrow you won't be dealing with additional low blood sugar. The one thing created stability for the other things to become possible later.

**Long-term solution**: You're in survival mode. Survival mode is not a failure state—it's a necessary state when you're dealing with a brain that's actively sabotaging you. In survival mode, doing one thing consistently is a massive achievement. When your depression lifts enough to move beyond survival mode, you'll add more. But survival mode habits keep you alive to reach that point. That's not nothing.

### Problem: "My depression got worse and even the floor version is impossible now"

**Why it happens**: Your depression severity increased beyond what the current floor version can handle. This means you're in crisis territory, or your floor needs to be reassessed.

**Quick fix**: Use the crisis protocol immediately—skip the habit, no shame, plan to restart. But also assess: Is this crisis (active suicidal ideation, complete inability to function) or is this a new baseline? If crisis, call 988 or go to the ER. If new baseline, you need a new floor version.

**Long-term solution**: If your depression worsened significantly, this is a medical issue requiring intervention. Talk to your doctor about medication adjustment or therapy intensity. Meanwhile, reassess your floor. If your old floor was "eat three bites," new floor might be "drink a nutrition shake from a straw while in bed." If old floor was "stand outside for 30 seconds," new floor might be "sit by open window for 10 seconds." When depression shifts, the floor shifts. Adapt rather than abandon.

## The Minimal Viable Version

**If you can barely function**: 
Your survival habit should be something that keeps you physically alive or prevents medical crisis. Options: take prescribed medication (if you have it), drink water, eat anything with calories. Floor version should be achievable without leaving your bed. Pre-position everything next to bed. Anchor it to the first time you're awake enough to notice you're awake. That's it.

**If you have no money**: 
Everything in this system can be free. Use paper and pen for tracking (steal a calendar page online and print at library if needed, or draw your own grid). Pre-position supplies using things you already own. Your survival habit should be something that costs nothing—taking meds you already have, drinking tap water, walking outside, brushing teeth with toothbrush and toothpaste you own. Money is not the barrier here.

**If you live with other people who don't understand depression**: 
Keep your habit and tracking system private if you need to. The streak calendar can go inside a closet or drawer—you don't need to see it from bed if that means others will see it and comment. Your survival habit can be something nobody else notices (taking meds, drinking water). You don't owe anyone an explanation of your system. If you do have someone supportive, you can share the crisis protocol with them so they can help you restart.

**If you have ADHD with your depression**: 
You need more external structure. Set a daily alarm for your anchor time. Put your supplies in the most disruptive location possible (middle of your desk, on your keyboard, on your closed laptop). Make the habit something you cannot avoid tripping over. The pre-positioning becomes even more critical because executive dysfunction + depression is a brutal combination. Consider body-doubling: tell someone "I'm taking my meds now" even if they don't respond—saying it out loud helps with initiation.

**If you're dealing with both depression and chronic pain**: 
Your survival habit needs to account for physical limitations. Floor version might be "take pain medication" if prescribed. Don't add physical movement habits unless movement is possible on floor days. The habit might be something entirely cognitive or passive: "listen to 5 minutes of music," "look at a photo that makes me feel something," "pet the cat." Depression + pain means survival habits focus purely on baseline functioning, not aspiration.

**If your depression includes suicidal ideation**: 
Your survival habit should be something that connects you to support or creates a barrier to crisis. Examples: "text my therapist or crisis line once per day," "check in with my safety person," "take my medication," "write three words in my phone to prove I'm still here." The floor version needs to be absurdly small because capacity during suicidal ideation is nearly zero. The crisis protocol needs to include emergency contact information. Please also ensure you have 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) saved in your phone and that your emergency contacts know you're struggling.

## Advanced Optimizations

### Optimization 1: The capacity-tracking system

**When to add this**: After 3+ months of maintaining your survival habit when you want to better predict and prepare for crashes.

**How to implement**: Add a simple capacity rating to your daily tracking. Each day, mark your habit completion AND rate your overall capacity on a 1-5 scale (1 = floor day, couldn't do basic tasks; 5 = good day, functioned well). Use different colored markers or symbols. After a month of capacity tracking, look for patterns: Do crashes follow certain triggers (poor sleep, stressful events, time of month)? How long do they last? Do you have warning signs? Once you identify patterns, you can prepare: when you see warning signs, immediately pre-position extra supplies, clear your schedule if possible, tell your support people you might need help soon.

**Expected improvement**: You gain predictability in an unpredictable condition. Many people discover their crashes have patterns they never noticed. This doesn't prevent crashes, but it removes some of the shock and allows preparation. You can move to floor-version-mode proactively instead of reactively.

### Optimization 2: The habit-pairing protocol

**When to add this**: After 6+ months of solid survival habit maintenance when you want to add a second habit without overloading yourself.

**How to implement**: Identify a second survival habit that would prevent deterioration in a different area. If your first habit is physical (taking meds), make the second social (text one person per day). If first is self-care (eating), make second environmental (put one dish in sink). Use the EXACT same tracking calendar but different colored marks. Same anchor time if possible, or a second reliable anchor. Most importantly: both habits keep their independent floor versions. You're not pairing execution (doing them at the same time necessarily), you're pairing tracking and sustainability systems. The crisis protocol applies to each independently.

**Expected improvement**: After 6 months, many people's depression management improves enough that they have capacity for a second survival habit. The pairing protocol keeps both habits at your floor on bad days while allowing both to expand on good days. This builds a more complete foundation of functioning without overwhelming you.

### Optimization 3: The external accountability option

**When to add this**: After 4+ months if you want additional motivation and have someone trustworthy.

**How to implement**: Find one person (friend, family member, therapist, online accountability partner) who understands depression. Share your three-tier system and crisis protocol with them. Each day, send them one message: "Floor" or "Middle" or "Full" or "Crisis" to indicate which version you completed. They respond with a simple acknowledgment (thumbs up emoji, "got it," etc.). No judgment, no advice, no cheerleading—just witnessing. On crisis protocol days, they send you the protocol as a reminder to restart tomorrow.

**Expected improvement**: Light accountability without pressure. The act of reporting creates mild motivation to not skip, but the acceptance of crisis protocol days prevents shame. Many people report that knowing someone will notice if they don't do the habit adds just enough external structure to boost consistency by 10-15%.

## What to Do When It Stops Working

**If you stopped doing the habit entirely for 2+ weeks:**
This is complete collapse. Don't try to restart where you left off. Go back to Phase 1, Step 1. Reassess your depression floor—it likely shifted. Pick your survival habit again (might be the same one or a different one). Create a new floor version appropriate to your current state. You're not starting over—you're adapting to new conditions. Depression is cyclical; habits during depression need to be rebuilt periodically. This is normal.

**If you're doing the habit but it's no longer preventing deterioration:**
The wrong habit for current needs. Example: if your survival habit was "eat something" but you're now eating fine and instead struggling with isolation, you need to switch to a social connection habit. The habit served its purpose; now you need a different one. Thank the old habit for what it did, then deliberately choose a new survival habit that addresses your current biggest deterioration risk.

**If the floor version stopped being doable:**
Your depression worsened significantly. This is a medical issue, not a habit issue. Contact your doctor or therapist immediately about treatment adjustment. Meanwhile, lower the floor version even more—there's no bottom to how small it can be. If "drink water" is too much, "wet your lips with water" is the new floor. If "take meds" is too much, "touch the pill bottle" is the new floor. You're keeping the neural pathway alive until treatment helps you recover capacity.

**If you hate the habit and resent doing it:**
You picked wrong. The habit should be neutral or mildly positive, never something you hate. If you hate taking medication, maybe the habit is "use pill timer to remember pill" and the taking is just a consequence. If you hate going outside, maybe the habit is "open window and breathe fresh air" instead. Sometimes we pick habits we think we "should" do. If resentment is building, switch to something that doesn't create emotional resistance.

The habit only truly stops working if you stop restarting it. As long as you restart—even if you restart 50 times—the habit is alive and working. The goal isn't perfection or even consistency. The goal is "still trying."

## Tools and Resources

**Essential**:
- Wall calendar or paper grid (free to make, $1-5 to buy): For visual streak tracking. Visible from bed. Mark with anything—pen, marker, stickers. Digital trackers require phone access and work for some people, but paper visible from bed is more reliable during severe depression episodes.
- Crisis protocol written down (free—paper and pen): On index card, taped to wall, or saved as phone background. Must be accessible when you're too depressed to remember it exists.

**Optional but helpful**:
- Weekly pill organizer ($5-15): Even if you're not tracking medication specifically, these are useful for keeping small supplies organized (vitamins, emergency snacks, earplugs, whatever supports your habit). Clear organizers let you see what's there.
- Water bottle with straw or spout ($8-20): Easier to drink from when lying down than a glass. Keep by bed at all times. Reduces barrier to hydration significantly.
- Duplicate supplies for pre-positioning ($10-30 total): Instead of moving one toothbrush between locations, buy 3 cheap ones. Instead of moving your pills, get a duplicate bottle. Instead of one set of supplies, set up 3 stations. Dollar stores are sufficient for this.

**Free resources**:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988, completely free and confidential): For crisis days that exceed crisis protocol capacity. Available 24/7. They don't judge, they don't force hospitalization, they help you get through the moment.
- NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) local support groups (free): Search "NAMI near me" to find local groups. Peer support from people who understand depression can help you feel less alone in the habit struggle.
- r/depression on Reddit (free): Active community where you can post about your habit struggles and get support from people who understand. Also r/NonZeroDay for the concept of doing any tiny thing to maintain forward motion.
- Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance resources (free): Online support groups, educational materials, crisis planning tools at dbsalliance.org.

## The Takeaway

Building habits during depression isn't about creating the perfect routine or becoming disciplined—it's about designing systems that work at your absolute worst and scale up when you have capacity. The habit that survives depression has three elements: a floor version you can do on terrible days, a crisis protocol that prevents shame spirals when you skip, and pre-positioned supplies that remove friction.

Start by identifying your depression floor—what you can actually do when barely functioning. Choose one survival habit that prevents deterioration, not one that creates improvement. Make the floor version so small it's almost embarrassing, and put everything you need to do it next to your bed. Track with visible marks on a calendar. When you skip, follow your crisis protocol and restart the next day.

Do this today: Pick your survival habit. Write down the floor version (absurdly small). Put the supplies next to your bed. Tomorrow, when your anchor happens, do the floor version once. That's day 1. You don't need to commit to forever. You need to commit to once.
