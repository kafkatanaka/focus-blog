## The Attention Paradox

We optimize our calendars and fill every slot. We track hours and measure output. Yet the thing that actually determines the quality of our work—**attention**—gets almost no direct management.

Time is finite and visible. Attention is finite but invisible. So we default to managing what we can see.

## Why Attention Beats Time

An hour of focused work can produce more value than a day of scattered effort. The variable isn’t the clock; it’s where your mind is.

When you treat attention as the scarce resource, you start to:

- Protect it (fewer context switches, fewer “quick checks”)
- Allocate it (decide in advance what gets your best focus)
- Replenish it (rest, sleep, and boundaries become non-negotiable)

## A Simple Shift

Instead of only asking “What will I do at 2pm?”, ask “What will get my full attention today, and when?”

That shift—from time blocks to attention blocks—is the core of the focus dividend. Less visible busywork, more invisible depth.
