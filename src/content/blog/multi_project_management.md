# How to Manage Multiple Projects Without Dropping Balls

You're good at your job. Maybe too good, because now you're managing five projects simultaneously. There's the client deliverable due Friday, the internal initiative your boss keeps asking about, the side project that's "just about done" (it isn't), and two more things you're pretty sure you've forgotten entirely. You check your task list and feel your chest tighten—47 items, and you can't remember which ones are actually urgent.

You've tried color-coded spreadsheets. You've adopted the latest productivity app. You've read articles about time management and Eisenhower matrices. But every system breaks down the same way: when all five projects heat up at once, you're making moment-to-moment decisions based on whoever shouted loudest or which Slack message you happened to see. Something important gets dropped. You only realize it when someone asks about it.

The anxiety isn't about the work itself—you can do the work. It's about the constant mental overhead of remembering what needs attention, the fear of missing something critical, and the exhausting triage of "which fire do I put out first?"

Here's how to actually do it.

**Core claim:** The secret to managing multiple projects isn't working harder or being more organized—it's building a visibility system that makes drops impossible and a triage method that removes the need for constant decision-making.

## Why Managing Multiple Projects Feels So Hard

The difficulty isn't about time management. You probably have enough hours. The problem is cognitive load compounding in invisible ways.

**The Context-Switching Tax**: Every time you switch between projects, you lose 10-20 minutes to mental recalibration. You need to remember where you left off, what the priorities are, who's waiting on what. Multiply this by five projects, and you're losing 2-3 hours per day just to overhead. This isn't a productivity hack problem. It's a structural reality of how human attention works.

**The Visibility Problem**: The project that's on fire gets attention. The project that's quietly approaching a deadline gets ignored until it's also on fire. You're not managing projects proactively—you're responding to urgency signals. This means you're always reactive, always behind, always putting out fires instead of preventing them.

**The Mental RAM Overload**: Your brain wasn't designed to hold five different contexts simultaneously. Every project has its own cast of stakeholders, its own pending decisions, its own next actions. Trying to keep all of this in your head creates a constant background anxiety. You can't fully focus on the task in front of you because part of your brain is worried about what you're forgetting in the other four projects.

**The Triage Paralysis**: When everything feels urgent and you can't do all of it, every transition becomes a decision point. Do you continue this task or switch to that one? Each micro-decision depletes your willpower. By 2pm, you're so decision-fatigued that you end up doing whatever requires the least mental effort—usually email—instead of what actually matters.

### The mistake most guides make

Most multi-project management advice focuses on scheduling and time-blocking: "Allocate specific time slots to each project." This assumes your work is predictable and interruptible. It's not. Stakeholders don't schedule their urgent requests. Bugs don't emerge on a timetable. Real work is messy and reactive.

Other guides recommend elaborate project management software with Gantt charts, dependency tracking, and resource allocation. That's great if you're managing a construction project with 50 people. But if you're a knowledge worker juggling multiple loosely-defined initiatives with shifting priorities, the overhead of maintaining that system becomes another project.

The most common advice—"just stay organized" or "prioritize ruthlessly"—ignores the fundamental problem: you need a system that doesn't rely on you remembering things, doesn't break when priorities shift, and works when you're tired and overwhelmed. That system needs to be external, visible, and require almost no maintenance.

## What You'll Need

**Time investment**: 
- Initial setup: 2 hours
- Daily maintenance: 10-15 minutes
- Weekly review: 45 minutes
- Monthly realignment: 1 hour

**Upfront cost**: 
- Free tier: $0 (sufficient for individuals)
- Team tier: $10-20/month (adds collaboration)
- Enterprise: $30+/month (overkill for most)

**Prerequisites**: 
- Ability to say "no" at least occasionally
- Access to a digital tool (spreadsheet, task manager, or project board)
- Calendar control (ability to block focus time)
- Basic understanding of your projects' deadlines

**Won't work if**: 
- You have zero control over your time (hourly tracked roles)
- All projects genuinely require real-time attention (on-call roles)
- You can't document anything (security clearance issues)
- Your organization punishes anyone who admits capacity limits

## The Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Building Visibility (Week 1, ~2 hours)

**Step 1: Create Your Project Dashboard (30 minutes)**

**What to do**: Open a spreadsheet or task management tool. Create one row per active project. Include exactly these columns:
- Project name
- Primary stakeholder
- Hard deadline (if any)
- Current status (Not Started / In Progress / Blocked / Done)
- Next action (single specific task)
- Last updated (date)

That's it. No elaborate fields. No priority scores yet. No dependency mapping.

**Why it matters**: You need to see all projects on one screen. Right now, they're scattered across email threads, Slack channels, meeting notes, and your memory. This creates the illusion that you can hold it all in your head. You can't. External visibility is the foundation of everything else.

**Common mistake**: Making the dashboard too detailed. Adding fields for "strategic importance" or "completion percentage" or "key milestones" feels productive but creates maintenance burden. Every field is a decision point. Start minimal.

**Quick check**: Can you see all your active projects without scrolling or switching tabs? If no, you have too many fields or too much information.

**Step 2: Capture Every Commitment (45 minutes)**

**What to do**: Go through your email, calendar, Slack, and meeting notes from the past two weeks. For every project you find:
1. Add it to your dashboard if it's not there
2. Identify who's expecting something from you
3. Write down the actual next physical action (not "work on proposal"—instead "draft executive summary")

Be honest about what you've actually committed to, even the things you're avoiding.

**Why it matters**: Most dropped balls happen because you never externalized the commitment. It lives in your email as something you mentally noted but never wrote down. Two weeks later, someone asks about it and you realize you forgot entirely. Capture everything now so you can see the full scope.

**Common mistake**: Only capturing "official" projects. The informal requests ("Can you take a look at this?"), the "quick favors" that aren't quick, the things you volunteered for in meetings—these count. They consume time and attention. If you're doing it, it goes on the list.

**Quick check**: Look at your sent emails from the past week. Did you promise to do anything that's not on your dashboard? If yes, add it now.

**Step 3: Assign Default Check-in Times (20 minutes)**

**What to do**: For each project, decide when you'll check its status:
- Daily: Active projects with imminent deadlines
- Weekly: Everything else in progress
- Biweekly: Projects on hold but not dead

Add a "Next Check" column to your dashboard and fill it in. Set actual calendar reminders.

**Why it matters**: Without explicit check-ins, you only think about projects when someone asks about them or when you randomly remember. This creates the panic of "oh no, I haven't touched that in two weeks." Scheduled check-ins mean nothing gets forgotten.

**Common mistake**: Checking everything daily "to be safe." This creates decision fatigue and makes the system feel burdensome. Most projects don't need daily attention. Reserve daily checks for genuinely urgent work.

**Quick check**: Do you have calendar reminders for at least your three most critical projects? If no, set them now.

**Step 4: Establish Your Communication Cadence (25 minutes)**

**What to do**: For each project, identify your primary stakeholder. Schedule a recurring check-in or decide on your update frequency:
- High-stakes projects: Weekly 15-minute check-in
- Standard projects: Async update every 1-2 weeks
- Low-stakes projects: Update only when status changes

Send a brief message to each stakeholder explaining your check-in cadence. "I'll send you updates every Friday" or "I'll ping you when I hit blockers."

**Why it matters**: Stakeholders ask for updates when they feel out of the loop. This creates interruptions at unpredictable times. By setting expectations upfront, you control when the communication happens. You also create accountability for yourself—knowing you have a weekly update due keeps the project on your radar.

**Common mistake**: Over-committing to frequent updates. Daily updates feel reassuring but become a burden. Most stakeholders care about signal, not noise. Weekly is usually sufficient unless something's actively broken.

**Quick check**: Have you told each stakeholder when they'll hear from you? If not, send those messages today.

**Checkpoint**: You should now have:
- A single dashboard showing all active projects
- Calendar reminders for project check-ins
- Stakeholder communication cadences set
- A complete (if overwhelming) view of your commitments

### Phase 2: Building the Triage System (Week 2, ~1 hour)

**Step 5: Implement the Two-Question Filter (15 minutes)**

**What to do**: Every morning, review your dashboard and ask two questions for each project:
1. "Will this cause visible damage if ignored today?" (deadline passes, stakeholder blocked, legal issue)
2. "Is someone waiting on me right now for something they can't do without?"

Answer honestly. Projects that hit "no" on both don't get attention today unless you have extra time.

**Why it matters**: You can't do everything today. This filter removes the paralysis of "what should I work on?" by identifying what will actually cause harm if ignored. Everything else is lower priority by definition.

**Common mistake**: Treating "important to me personally" as damage. Strategic initiatives matter, but if they're not on fire today, they lose to the things that are. Reserve specific time for important-not-urgent work (see Step 7).

**Quick check**: Look at your project list right now. How many projects genuinely need attention today? If the answer is "all of them," you're not being honest about consequences.

**Step 6: Create Your Hold Pattern (20 minutes)**

**What to do**: Identify projects that are genuinely important but not urgent. Create a separate "Active Backlog" section on your dashboard. These projects get:
- A defined next action (so you can resume quickly)
- A weekly check-in (to catch if they become urgent)
- Protection from guilt (they're intentionally on hold)

Tell the relevant stakeholders: "This is on my list for [timeframe]. If you need it sooner, let me know and I'll re-prioritize."

**Why it matters**: You can't work on eight things simultaneously. Some projects need to be explicitly on hold. Without a hold pattern, these projects create constant guilt and anxiety. Naming them as "intentionally deprioritized" removes the mental load.

**Common mistake**: Thinking everything can stay "in progress." You have 3-5 projects max that can receive real attention in any given week. Everything else is waiting. Admit this explicitly instead of pretending you'll "find time."

**Quick check**: How many projects are actually receiving meaningful progress this week? That's your capacity. Everything else goes to the backlog.

**Step 7: Block Your Focus Time (25 minutes)**

**What to do**: Look at your calendar for the next two weeks. Block 90-minute chunks for your top-priority projects:
- Block recurring time (e.g., Tuesdays 9-10:30am for Project A)
- Block at least 2 sessions per week per active project
- Label blocks clearly: "Project Alpha - heads down work"
- Decline meetings during these blocks unless absolutely critical

**Why it matters**: Without protected time, you'll spend entire days in reactive mode—responding to messages, attending meetings, putting out fires. Projects need sustained attention to make progress. Two 90-minute blocks per week is minimum viable momentum.

**Common mistake**: Blocking time but not defending it. When someone requests a meeting during your block, offer an alternative time. If you immediately move your blocked time, it stops being real.

**Quick check**: Open your calendar. Do you have at least two 90-minute blocks protected for your most critical project this week? If not, add them now.

**What to expect in Phase 2**:
- Initial relief at having a system
- Anxiety when you realize how many projects are on hold
- Pushback from stakeholders used to instant responses
- Temptation to abandon the system when things get busy

**Don't panic if**:
- You miss a check-in (do it the next day)
- A project blows up despite being "low priority" (re-triage immediately)
- Someone complains about your communication cadence (negotiate, don't cave)
- Your dashboard shows you have 12 active projects (you'll address this in Phase 3)

### Phase 3: Sustainable Operations (Week 3+)

**Step 8: Implement the Weekly Review Ritual (45 minutes, every Sunday or Monday)**

**What to do**: Set a recurring 45-minute meeting with yourself. During this time:
- Update each project's status and next action (15 minutes)
- Check if any projects have shifted from backlog to urgent (5 minutes)
- Review upcoming deadlines for the next 3 weeks (5 minutes)
- Plan your focus blocks for the coming week (10 minutes)
- Identify anything you need to delegate or decline (10 minutes)

**Why it matters**: This is when you catch problems before they become fires. A deadline you hadn't internalized suddenly appears next week—you have time to prepare. A blocked project has been blocked for two weeks—you can escalate. This is your early warning system.

**Common mistake**: Skipping the review when things feel calm. That's exactly when you need it—calm means you're not reacting to fires, which means you have mental space to prevent them.

**Quick check**: Is your weekly review on your calendar, recurring, with no other meetings scheduled at that time? If not, set it up now.

**Step 9: Develop Your "No" Protocol (ongoing)**

**What to do**: When someone asks you to take on something new, use this script:

"Let me check my current commitments. [Look at dashboard.] I'm currently managing [X] projects with deadlines of [dates]. I can take this on, but it means [Project Y] will be delayed by [timeframe]. Does that work?"

This isn't asking permission. It's making the trade-off visible.

**Why it matters**: You can't say no without showing why. When you make your workload visible, reasonable people will adjust their expectations. Unreasonable people will demand the impossible anyway, but at least you've documented it.

**Common mistake**: Saying yes immediately because you don't know your capacity. The dashboard makes capacity concrete. Use it.

**Quick check**: Did you accept a new commitment this week? Did you explicitly identify what it bumped?

**Step 10: Create Your Handoff Documentation (as needed)**

**What to do**: For any project that might need to be handed off (vacation, sick leave, overload):
- Keep a one-page "state of the project" doc
- Include: current status, pending decisions, key contacts, next actions
- Update it during your weekly review
- Don't wait until handoff is urgent

**Why it matters**: When you need to delegate or go on vacation, "download my brain" becomes a multi-hour panic. A current state doc means handoff takes 20 minutes. It also clarifies your thinking about the project.

**Common mistake**: Creating elaborate documentation that's always out of date. One page, bullet points, updated weekly. That's sufficient.

**Quick check**: Could someone take over your most critical project with 30 minutes of reading? If not, document it.

**Signs it's working**:
- You stop feeling surprised by deadlines
- Stakeholders stop asking "what's the status?"
- You have time for actual deep work
- Dropped balls become rare events, not weekly occurrences

**Red flags**:
- Dashboard has 15+ active projects (you need to decline or delegate)
- You're still working nights/weekends regularly (capacity problem, not system problem)
- Weekly review takes more than an hour (too much complexity)
- You're avoiding the dashboard because it's overwhelming (see "What to Do When It Stops Working")

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Chen, Engineering Manager at a Scale-up

**Context**: Chen managed four development teams while also acting as technical lead on two critical customer implementations. Every day brought 50+ Slack messages, three meetings, and multiple "quick questions" that weren't quick. She was consistently missing code review deadlines and forgetting to follow up on architectural decisions. Her team was frustrated by the delays.

**How she adapted it**: Chen created a Notion board with six columns: Active (Daily), Active (Weekly), Blocked, Waiting On Others, Backlog, and Done. Every morning she moved projects between columns based on actual status. She set a rule: "Active (Daily)" could have maximum three items. Everything else went to Weekly or Backlog. She also created a public "When to Expect Responses" doc that told her team: code reviews within 24 hours, architecture questions answered in Friday office hours, everything else in weekly 1-on-1s. This let her batch similar work and reduced constant context-switching.

**Result**: Dropped commitments went from 2-3 per week to 1-2 per month. Her team reported that she seemed "less scattered." More importantly, she stopped working 10-hour days because she was no longer re-processing the same information multiple times. The explicit queue made it clear when she was overloaded—she could point to the board and say "I'm at capacity" with evidence.

### Example 2: Maya, Freelance Content Strategist

**Context**: Maya juggled five clients with varying deadlines, communication styles, and project scopes. She was using a mix of email flags, Google Calendar, and mental notes. She regularly forgot to invoice clients on time, missed content approval cycles, and found herself scrambling the night before deliverables were due. She wanted to scale to more clients but couldn't because she was already drowning.

**How she adapted it**: Maya created a simple Airtable base with one table for projects and another for deliverables. Each project linked to its deliverables with due dates. She set up automations to email her three days before any deadline. Most critically, she implemented a "no project starts without a kickoff doc" rule—every project got a one-page document with scope, deliverables, deadlines, and communication expectations. This forced clients to be clear about what they wanted upfront instead of via scattered emails.

**Result**: She scaled from five to eight clients without increasing stress. The kickoff docs reduced scope creep by 60% because expectations were documented. She stopped working weekends because deadlines were visible three days out instead of surprising her. The automation meant her brain could stop being her task manager.

### Example 3: David, Internal Consultant at a Corporation

**Context**: David was pulled into multiple departments' projects as a subject matter expert. He had no formal authority over these projects but was expected to deliver recommendations, attend meetings, and review documents. His calendar was 80% meetings with 20% time for actual work. He was behind on deliverables for three separate departments and had started avoiding email because the volume was overwhelming.

**How he adapted it**: David created a spreadsheet with brutal honesty about capacity. He listed every project, the time commitment expected, and his actual weekly capacity (12 hours after meetings). The math showed he was committed to 25 hours of work per week. He used this spreadsheet in a meeting with his manager to re-prioritize. They agreed on three active projects; everything else got queued. He sent an email to stakeholders in the queued projects: "I'm unavailable for this until [date]. If that doesn't work, please escalate through my manager." He stopped attending meetings for projects he wasn't actively working on.

**Result**: Initially, there was pushback. Two stakeholders escalated to his manager, who backed him up because the spreadsheet made capacity clear. Within a month, the organization learned he had boundaries. His quality of work increased because he was no longer half-attending to eight things. He got a reputation for "actually delivering" instead of "always in meetings but nothing happens."

## Common Problems and Fixes

### Problem: "My dashboard shows 15 active projects and I can't decide what to cut"

**Why it happens**: You've said yes to too much, and nothing has a clear owner to push back on. Or you're in an organizational culture that expects everyone to do everything.

**Quick fix**: Force rank the projects 1-15. Then draw a line after #5. Projects 6-15 go to your manager with this message: "Here's my current workload. I can actively work on the top 5. For 6-15, I need you to either extend deadlines, reassign them, or tell me which of the top 5 to drop."

**Long-term solution**: Implement a formal intake process. New projects must come through a single channel (email, form, ticket) where you can respond with "added to queue, expected start date [X]" or "beyond current capacity, please route to [alternate]."

### Problem: "Everything is urgent according to stakeholders, so the triage system doesn't work"

**Why it happens**: Your organization has a culture of false urgency, or you work with stakeholders who cry wolf constantly.

**Quick fix**: Add a column to your dashboard: "Real Deadline" vs "Requested Deadline." Real deadline = contractual obligation, regulatory requirement, or dependency blocking others. Requested deadline = someone wants it then. Triage based on real deadlines.

**Long-term solution**: Train stakeholders by being reliable on actual deadlines and comfortable missing arbitrary ones. When someone says "urgent," ask "what breaks if we miss this deadline?" Most of the time, the answer is "nothing." The first few times you miss arbitrary deadlines, you'll get complaints. After that, stakeholders learn to be honest about priority.

### Problem: "I do the weekly review for two weeks, then stop when things get busy"

**Why it happens**: When you're overwhelmed, the review feels like more work. You skip it once, then guilt prevents you from restarting.

**Quick fix**: Reduce the review to 15 minutes and only update the "Next Check" dates and critical next actions. You can expand back to 45 minutes when life calms down.

**Long-term solution**: The weekly review is most valuable when you're overwhelmed. That's when you most need to see the full picture. Treat it like a meeting with your most important client (yourself). Would you skip that because you're busy?

### Problem: "My system works for normal times but collapses when everything hits at once"

**Why it happens**: The system isn't designed for crisis mode. You need a different approach when genuinely underwater.

**Quick fix**: Activate "crisis mode": pick the two projects that absolutely cannot fail this week. Communicate to all other stakeholders: "I'm underwater this week. [Project X and Y] will get updates; everything else is paused until [date]." Then honor that.

**Long-term solution**: Recognize that "crisis mode" more than once a month means chronic overload, not crisis. You need to permanently reduce commitments, not just manage the current fire. Use the pattern of recurring crises to justify difficult conversations about capacity.

### Problem: "I'm managing the projects fine but burning out from the constant switching"

**Why it happens**: You've solved the visibility and triage problems but not the attention management problem.

**Quick fix**: Implement theme days or half-days. Monday/Wednesday = Project A, Tuesday/Thursday = Project B, Friday = everything else. Even if you still need to check all projects daily, you only do deep work on specific days.

**Long-term solution**: Push for project consolidation. Most people can handle 2-3 active projects without burnout. Four starts getting hard. Five+ means something needs to be delegated, queued, or canceled. Use your dashboard to show decision-makers the actual cognitive load.

## The Minimal Viable Version

**If you only have 30 minutes**: 
1. Open a spreadsheet
2. List all your projects with stakeholder and deadline
3. Set a weekly reminder to update it
That's the system. You now have visibility.

**If you only have $0**: 
- Google Sheets or Excel (already have it)
- Google Calendar reminders (free)
- Your email (already using it)
No premium tools needed.

**If you only have 15 minutes per week**: 
- Skip the daily triage
- Do a weekly review where you update all statuses at once
- Rely on calendar deadlines for urgency signals
- This is suboptimal but better than nothing

**If you work in a highly reactive role (support, operations)**:
- Keep the dashboard but reduce granularity—just track "This Week" vs "Later"
- Use your calendar for focus blocks, but accept you might get interrupted
- Set clearer boundaries with stakeholders about response times
- Consider a daily 30-minute recap at end of day instead of continuous tracking

## Advanced Optimizations

### Optimization 1: Automated Status Updates

**When to add this**: After Month 2, once your dashboard is stable and you have consistent data flow.

**How to implement**:
1. Connect your project dashboard to Slack, email, or your team tool
2. Set up weekly automated updates that pull status from your dashboard
3. Format: "Project X: [Status] | Next: [Action] | Updated: [Date]"
4. Send these automatically every Friday at 4pm
5. Stakeholders now get updates without you manually writing them

**Expected improvement**: Saves 30-60 minutes per week on status updates. Reduces "what's the status?" messages by 70%. Creates a paper trail of communication without effort.

### Optimization 2: Template-Based Project Intake

**When to add this**: When you're consistently receiving new projects and need to standardize how they start.

**How to implement**:
1. Create a project intake form (Google Form, Notion, or even an email template)
2. Required fields: Project name, stakeholder, deliverables, deadline, success criteria
3. When someone asks you to do something, send them the form
4. Don't start the project until the form is complete
5. Use form responses to auto-populate your dashboard

**Expected improvement**: Reduces vague projects by 80%. Forces stakeholders to clarify expectations upfront. Gives you permission to say "I need more information before committing."

### Optimization 3: Capacity Forecasting

**When to add this**: Month 3+, when you have historical data on how long projects actually take.

**How to implement**:
1. Add "Estimated Hours" and "Actual Hours" columns to past projects
2. Calculate your average estimation error (usually 30-50% underestimate)
3. When estimating new projects, multiply by your error factor
4. Track your available hours per week (calendar hours minus meetings minus 20% buffer)
5. Only commit to projects that fit in your available hours

**Expected improvement**: More realistic commitments. Fewer late deliverables. Better negotiations with stakeholders about timelines.

## What to Do When It Stops Working

The system will break. Not because it's bad, but because your work changes, your capacity changes, or organizational chaos overwhelms any system.

**Symptom**: Dashboard has grown to 20+ projects and you've stopped updating it.
**Diagnosis**: You're tracking too much or haven't closed completed projects.
**Fix**: Archive everything marked "Done." Move anything without activity in 30+ days to a separate "Dormant" sheet. If the dashboard still has 15+ items, you have a workload problem, not a system problem. Time for the difficult conversation with management.

**Symptom**: Weekly review takes 90+ minutes and feels like a chore.
**Diagnosis**: Too much overhead relative to value. You're tracking details that don't matter.
**Fix**: Delete 50% of your columns. If you haven't looked at a field in three weeks, you don't need it. Keep only: Project Name, Stakeholder, Status, Next Action, Next Check. That's sufficient.

**Symptom**: You still feel surprised by deadlines despite the system.
**Diagnosis**: Either you're not doing the weekly review consistently, or you're not updating deadlines when they change (and they always change).
**Fix**: Add a standing item to your weekly review: "Did any deadlines shift this week?" Update them immediately when you hear about changes, even if it's mid-week.

**Symptom**: System works but you're still working 60-hour weeks.
**Diagnosis**: The system is revealing that you're overloaded, but you haven't acted on that information.
**Fix**: The dashboard is working perfectly—it's showing you that you have too much work. You need fewer commitments, not better management. Use the dashboard as evidence in conversations about capacity.

**When to simplify**: If you dread opening the dashboard, it's too complex. Reduce to bare minimum: project names and next actions only. Build back up slowly.

**When to abandon entirely**: If you're in a role where projects are genuinely unpredictable minute-to-minute (emergency services, live production support), formal project tracking may be incompatible with the work. Focus instead on response protocols and handoff documentation.

## Tools and Resources

### Essential

**Project Dashboard** (pick ONE):
- **Google Sheets/Excel**: Universally accessible, no learning curve, works offline. Best for individuals. Free.
- **Notion**: Flexible views, great for linking projects to documents. Best for documentation-heavy work. Free for individuals.
- **Trello**: Visual board, drag-and-drop status updates. Best for visual thinkers. Free tier sufficient.
- **Asana**: More structure, good for teams. Best when you need to share with others. Free for basic use.

**Free alternatives to premium features**:
- Instead of project management software: A simple text file with project names and status
- Instead of automation tools: Manual weekly updates (30 minutes isn't that much time)
- Instead of team dashboards: A shared Google Sheet

### Optional but helpful

**Time tracking** (to build capacity awareness):
- Toggl Track (free tier)
- RescueTime (automatic tracking)
- Or a paper log of hours per project per day for two weeks

**Communication templates**:
- Status update template: "Project X is [status]. Completed: [last action]. Next: [next action]. Blockers: [if any]."
- Capacity conversation script: "I'm currently committed to [X] projects. Taking this on means [Y] moves to [date]. Should I proceed?"

### Free resources

**Dashboard template** (copy and customize):
```
| Project | Stakeholder | Deadline | Status | Next Action | Last Updated | Next Check |
|---------|------------|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|------------|
```

**Weekly review checklist**:
- [ ] Update all project statuses
- [ ] Check deadlines in next 3 weeks
- [ ] Block focus time for active projects
- [ ] Identify anything blocked and escalate
- [ ] Note capacity and flag overload

## The Takeaway

Managing multiple projects is fundamentally about visibility and triage. You need an external system that shows you everything you're committed to, a method for deciding what to work on today, and protected time to actually do the work. The specific tools matter less than the consistency of practice.

Start with the dashboard today. Spend 30 minutes listing every project you're currently involved with, even the small ones. That alone will change how you see your workload. The rest of the system builds from there—weekly reviews to catch problems early, triage to reduce decision fatigue, and communication cadences to prevent surprises.

**Start today**: Open a spreadsheet. List every project you're responsible for. That's step one. You now have visibility you didn't have an hour ago.
