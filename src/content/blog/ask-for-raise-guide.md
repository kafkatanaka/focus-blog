You've been at your company for two years. You've taken on more responsibilities, you've exceeded every goal, and you know you're underpaid compared to market rate. But every time you think about asking for a raise, you talk yourself out of it. The timing never feels right. You don't want to seem greedy. You're worried they'll say no, or worse, that asking will make you look ungrateful or mark you as a flight risk. So you keep waiting for them to notice your value and proactively offer you more money. They won't.

Here's what you need to understand: companies pay you the minimum amount you'll accept to stay, not what you're worth. Your manager probably knows you're underpaid. HR definitely knows. They're not going to fix it unless you force the conversation. And waiting until you're so frustrated that you threaten to leave is the worst possible strategy—by then you've already damaged the relationship and you're negotiating from desperation, not strength.

**Raise negotiations fail when you treat them like asking for a favor instead of presenting a business case for updated compensation.**

## Why Asking for a Raise Feels Impossible

The standard advice says "just ask!" as if the problem is that you haven't thought of asking. The problem isn't that you don't know to ask. The problem is that asking feels like putting a target on your back. You're worried that even bringing it up signals you're unhappy, which makes you look like a retention risk, which makes them start thinking about whether they actually need you. This isn't paranoia—some managers genuinely react this way, especially at dysfunctional companies.

The real complexity is that raise conversations are asymmetric information battles. You don't know what budget your manager has, what your coworkers make, what the company considers "normal" raises versus "exceptional" ones, or whether the person you're asking actually has authority to approve what you're requesting. Your manager knows all of this. They also know that most people won't ask, and if they do ask, most will accept the first counteroffer. This information gap means you're negotiating blind while they have perfect visibility.

The anxiety compounds because the stakes are high and unclear. A successful negotiation could mean $10k-30k more per year. A failed one could mean being passed over for promotion, getting a reputation as "difficult," or worst case, being managed out. You have no idea which outcome is more likely, so you default to not asking because the downside risk feels worse than the upside gain.

### The mistake most guides make

Generic raise advice tells you to "document your achievements" and "know your worth" but doesn't address the political reality of how raises actually get approved. They don't tell you what to do when your manager says "I agree you deserve it but I don't have budget" (is this real or a deflection?). They don't address how to ask when you're already being paid "fairly" but you know you could make 30% more elsewhere. They definitely don't tell you what to do when you ask and get rejected—do you immediately start job hunting, do you ask again in six months, or have you just permanently damaged your relationship?

Most guides also assume you work at a rational company with clear compensation bands and merit-based pay. They don't address what happens when you work somewhere with nepotism, favoritism, or arbitrary pay decisions. They assume your manager is an advocate who wants to pay you fairly. Sometimes they are. Often they're not—they're optimizing for their budget, not your compensation.

## What You'll Need

**Time investment**: 4-6 weeks total (1 week for research and prep, 1-2 weeks for strategic timing, 1 hour for the actual conversation, 2-4 weeks for approval process and follow-up)

**Upfront cost**: $0-50 ($0 for free salary research, $20-50 for premium salary data sites if needed for senior roles)

**Prerequisites**: 
- At least 6-12 months at current company (ideally 1+ year)
- Track record of meeting or exceeding expectations
- Clear understanding of market rate for your role
- Documented evidence of your impact (metrics, projects, responsibilities)
- Manager who has authority to approve raises (or you know the approval chain)
- Financial ability to walk away if they say no (3-6 months expenses saved)

**Won't work if**: 
- You're currently on a performance improvement plan
- You were just promoted or got a raise in the past 6 months
- Company is in hiring freeze or layoffs
- You have no evidence of impact beyond "showing up and doing your job"
- Your manager has explicitly told you they have zero budget authority
- You're planning to quit regardless of outcome (negotiate the new job offer instead)

## The Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Research and Documentation (Week 1)

**Step 1: Determine your actual market value**

- What to do: Research what your role pays at comparable companies in your market. Use multiple sources: Levels.fyi (tech), Glassdoor, Payscale, Blind, salary surveys from professional associations, and most importantly—actually talking to recruiters and taking interviews to get real offers. Don't rely on a single source. Collect data on: base salary, total compensation (bonus, equity, benefits), and what specific skills or experience levels command premium pay. For your specific role title, company size, location, and years of experience.
- Why it matters: "I feel underpaid" is not compelling. "I'm currently making $85k and the market rate for senior software engineers with my experience in this city is $110-130k based on Levels.fyi data from 40 companies" is compelling. You need concrete data to establish that your request is reasonable, not arbitrary.
- Common mistake: Looking only at senior FAANG salaries when you work at a startup, or only looking at national averages when you work in a low cost-of-living area. Compare to *actually comparable* companies and markets.
- Quick check: You can cite three different data sources showing a consistent salary range for your role, and you understand what factors (company size, industry, location) affect that range.

**Step 2: Document your expanded scope and impact**

- What to do: Create a document listing everything you do now that wasn't in your original job description or wasn't expected at your level. Include: new responsibilities you've taken on, projects you've led or significantly contributed to, problems you've solved, processes you've improved, and quantified business impact where possible (revenue generated, costs saved, efficiency improvements, risks mitigated). Go back 6-12 months. For each item, note the business value, not just the activity. "Mentored three junior engineers who are now productive team members" is better than "Did mentoring."
- Why it matters: You're building the case that your job has grown beyond what you were hired for, which means your compensation should grow too. The narrative is: you've outgrown your current level and deserve to be paid for the job you're actually doing, not the one you were hired for.
- Common mistake: Listing activities instead of outcomes. "Attended 50 meetings about X" isn't valuable. "Led cross-functional initiative that resulted in Y" is. Focus on impact and scope expansion.
- Quick check: You have 8-12 concrete examples of expanded scope or impact, at least half with quantified outcomes, covering the past 6-12 months.

**Step 3: Understand your company's compensation process**

- What to do: Research how raises get approved at your company. Talk to people who've successfully gotten raises—what was the process, who approved it, how long did it take? Check employee handbooks for official policy on compensation reviews. Identify whether raises happen on a standard cycle (annual reviews, promotion cycles) or ad-hoc. Find out if your manager has budget authority or if this goes to their boss, HR, or compensation committee. Understand the difference between merit increases (standard 3-5%), market adjustments (for underpaid people), and promotion increases (larger, tied to level change).
- Why it matters: The strategy for asking is completely different if raises only happen during annual review cycles versus if your manager can approve them anytime. If you don't know the approval process, you might pitch perfectly but to the wrong person, or at the wrong time in the budget cycle.
- Common mistake: Assuming your manager can just "give you a raise" when often they need to build a business case for their boss or HR, and timing matters for budget availability.
- Quick check: You can answer: When do raises typically happen here? Who approves them? What's the difference between a merit increase and market adjustment? How long does approval typically take?

**Checkpoint**: By end of week 1, you know you're underpaid by a specific amount based on market data, you have documented proof of expanded scope and impact, and you understand your company's compensation approval process.

### Phase 2: Strategic Timing and Positioning (Weeks 2-3)

**Step 4: Choose your timing strategically**

- What to do: Don't ask randomly. Ideal timing: (1) Right after a major win or successful project completion, (2) During annual review cycles when budgets are being allocated, (3) When your manager is planning next quarter or next year and thinking about team needs, (4) After your manager has publicly praised your work or you've received positive feedback. Avoid: (1) Right before or during performance reviews (too predictable), (2) During budget freezes or right after layoffs, (3) When your manager is dealing with a crisis, (4) Right after you've made a mistake or missed a deadline, (5) During your first month back from extended leave.
- Why it matters: The same request gets different responses based on timing. After you've just saved a project from disaster, your manager is predisposed to say yes. When the company just announced hiring freeze, they're predisposed to say no regardless of your merit.
- Common mistake: Waiting for "perfect" timing that never comes, or asking at the worst possible time (right after company announces budget cuts) because you've psyched yourself up and don't want to wait.
- Quick check: You've identified a specific window in the next 2-4 weeks that fits at least two of the "ideal timing" criteria and none of the "avoid" criteria.

**Step 5: Pre-wire your manager (optional but powerful)**

- What to do: 2-4 weeks before asking formally, start planting seeds. In your 1-on-1s, mention you've been thinking about career growth and compensation. Ask your manager what it would take to get to the next level or get a significant raise—don't ask for it yet, just ask what the criteria are. Use their answer to shape your actual pitch. This does three things: (1) signals you're thinking about this so it's not a surprise, (2) lets you tailor your case to what they care about, (3) gives them time to think about it instead of forcing an immediate reaction.
- Why it matters: Managers hate being surprised with raise requests in the moment. They need time to think, check budget, consult HR. Pre-wiring means when you formally ask, they've already been thinking about it and may have already started the approval process.
- Common mistake: Being so subtle in pre-wiring that your manager doesn't realize you're signaling, or being so obvious that it feels like a threat ("I've been thinking about my options...").
- Quick check: Your manager knows you're thinking about compensation/advancement, but you haven't made a formal ask yet. They've told you (even vaguely) what the bar is for increases.

**Step 6: Prepare your pitch and practice it**

- What to do: Write out your raise request as a structured pitch. Format: (1) Appreciation and context (30 sec), (2) Your expanded scope and impact (2 min), (3) Market data showing you're underpaid (1 min), (4) Specific request (30 sec), (5) Open for discussion. Practice out loud until you can deliver it conversationally without notes. Record yourself and watch for verbal tics ("um," "like"), apologetic language ("I know this might not be a good time but..."), or defensive body language. The goal is confident, matter-of-fact, collaborative tone.
- Why it matters: You'll be nervous in the actual conversation. Practicing means muscle memory kicks in and you don't fumble the key points. You sound prepared and professional, not emotional or desperate.
- Common mistake: Over-scripting so you sound robotic, or under-preparing so you ramble and forget key points. The sweet spot is structured but conversational.
- Quick check: You can deliver your entire pitch in 5 minutes or less without notes, and it hits all five parts in order. A friend or partner has heard it and says it sounds confident and reasonable.

**What to expect**: You'll rewrite your pitch multiple times because the first version will feel too aggressive, the second too passive, and the third will finally feel right. You'll practice in front of the mirror and feel ridiculous. You'll wonder if you should just send an email instead (don't—these conversations need to be live). This is all normal.

**Don't panic if**: Your manager seems surprised or says they need to think about it when you pre-wire. That's actually good—it means they're taking it seriously and not reflexively saying no. Surprise means you've initiated a real conversation.

### Phase 3: The Ask and Follow-Through (Weeks 3-6)

**Step 7: Make the formal request in the right format**

- What to do: Request a dedicated meeting with your manager. Don't ambush them in a regular 1-on-1 or during a casual conversation. Calendar invite subject: "Compensation Discussion" or "Career Development Conversation." When they ask what it's about, be direct: "I'd like to discuss my compensation relative to my current scope and market rate." In the meeting, deliver your prepared pitch. Use this exact structure:

**SCRIPT - OPENING:**
"Thanks for making time for this. I want to discuss my compensation. I've really valued my time here and the opportunity to [specific thing you've enjoyed]. I want to continue growing here, and I'd like to make sure my compensation reflects the scope of what I'm doing now and the value I'm bringing."

**SCRIPT - EXPANDED SCOPE:**
"When I started [timeframe] ago, my primary focus was [original scope]. Over the past [timeframe], that's expanded significantly. I'm now [list 3-4 major responsibilities or achievements with quantified impact]. This is beyond what my role was originally scoped for, and I'm effectively operating at [next level up]."

**SCRIPT - MARKET DATA:**
"I've done research on market rates for [your role] with my experience level in [your market]. Based on data from [cite sources], the range is [range], which means I'm currently [X% or $Y] below market. I understand we may not match the absolute top of market, but I'd like to discuss bringing my compensation in line with what's standard for the scope I'm handling."

**SCRIPT - THE ASK:**
"I'm requesting [specific number or range], which would bring me to [percentile] of market rate and reflect the expanded scope I've taken on. What are your thoughts on this?"

Then stop talking and listen. Let them respond.

- Why it matters: Being specific and direct shows you're serious and prepared. Framing it as a discussion rather than a demand keeps it collaborative. Providing both your expanded scope and market data gives them two justifications to support your request.
- Common mistake: Apologizing before you ask, asking what they "think about maybe giving you a raise," or making it about personal financial needs instead of business value.
- Quick check: You've requested a dedicated meeting (not bringing it up in passing), you can deliver your pitch in under 5 minutes, and your ask includes a specific number.

**Step 8: Handle objections without folding**

- What to do: Prepare responses to common objections:

**OBJECTION: "I don't have budget right now"**
RESPONSE: "I understand budget constraints. When would be the right time to revisit this? Can we plan for this to be included in next quarter's budget?" or "Is there flexibility to do a market adjustment now and then review again during normal cycle?" Don't accept this without a specific timeline.

**OBJECTION: "You just got a raise [6-12 months ago]"**
RESPONSE: "I appreciate that increase. Since then, I've taken on [new responsibilities], which represents significant scope expansion beyond what that raise reflected. I'm not asking for a standard merit increase—I'm asking for a market adjustment based on the role I'm actually doing now."

**OBJECTION: "That's not in line with our bands for your level"**
RESPONSE: "That's helpful context. It sounds like my scope may have grown beyond my current level. Can we discuss what it would take for a level promotion? Based on what I'm doing, it seems like I'm already performing at [next level]." (Shift from raise discussion to promotion discussion.)

**OBJECTION: "Other people in your role don't make that much"**
RESPONSE: "I understand. I'm not asking to be paid more than others in the role—I'm asking to be paid what the market shows for the work I'm doing and the impact I'm having. If there's a gap between our internal bands and market rate, that might be something to address more broadly."

**OBJECTION: "We'll look at this during your next review"**
RESPONSE: "I appreciate that, but my next review is [X months] away. Given that I'm currently [X%] below market and have been performing at this level for [timeframe], I'd like to address this sooner. What would need to happen to approve an off-cycle adjustment?"

- Why it matters: Most managers give soft nos hoping you'll drop it. Prepared responses show you've thought this through and aren't easily deterred. You're negotiating, not accepting the first answer.
- Common mistake: Accepting vague promises ("we'll look at it later") without getting specific timelines or commitments.
- Quick check: For each objection, you have a prepared response that either solves the stated problem or reveals whether it's a real obstacle or a deflection.

**Step 9: Get the outcome documented in writing**

- What to do: If they say yes (or yes with conditions), get it in writing immediately. Send a follow-up email same day: "Thanks for the conversation today. To confirm my understanding: my compensation will increase to [amount] effective [date], contingent on [any conditions they mentioned]. I appreciate you advocating for this, and I'm excited to continue contributing at this level." If they say they need to think about it or get approval, set a specific follow-up date: "When should I follow up with you on this? I want to make sure we keep this moving." Don't let it drift into indefinite limbo.
- Why it matters: Verbal agreements mean nothing until they're documented and you see the actual paycheck increase. Managers have good intentions but get busy and "forget" to process paperwork. Your job is to keep this on their radar.
- Common mistake: Assuming "yes" means it's done. Until you see it in your paycheck or get a formal offer letter/compensation change document, it's not real.
- Quick check: You have written confirmation of either (1) the approved raise amount and effective date, or (2) specific next steps and timeline if approval is pending.

**Step 10: Decide your next move based on the outcome**

- What to do: If approved: Great. Deliver on your commitments and note this success for next negotiation. If delayed but manager seems supportive: Accept the delay ONCE with a hard deadline. "I understand you need to get approval. Can we plan for this to be finalized by [specific date]?" If that date passes with no movement, escalate or start job hunting. If rejected: You have three options: (1) Accept it and try again in 6-12 months with more ammunition, (2) Start job hunting actively but stay professional at current role, (3) Escalate to your skip-level or HR if you believe the rejection was unfair. Choose based on: do you still want to stay here? Is there a path forward? Are they being honest about constraints?
- Why it matters: How you respond to the outcome determines whether this conversation helped or hurt your career at this company. Accepting a no gracefully while privately planning your exit is valid. Threatening to quit if they don't pay you more is usually career-limiting.
- Common mistake: Emotionally reacting to a no by either getting visibly upset (burns bridges) or immediately announcing you're job hunting (makes you a retention risk). Or accepting a vague "we'll revisit in the future" with no specific timeline.
- Quick check: Within 48 hours of getting the final answer, you've decided and documented your plan: stay and revisit in X months, start job hunting while staying professional, or escalate through official channels.

**Signs it's working**: Your manager takes your request seriously and doesn't dismiss it immediately. They schedule follow-up conversations or mention needing to check with HR/their boss. They ask clarifying questions about your market data or scope expansion (they're testing your case). Within 2-4 weeks, you have either approval or a specific reason for delay with clear next steps.

**Red flags**: Your manager gets defensive or acts like you're being disloyal by asking. They refuse to discuss market data ("we don't pay based on market"). They make vague promises with no timeline ("we'll look at this later"). They imply you should be grateful for having a job. They tell you other people aren't complaining. Any of these signals either a bad manager or a dysfunctional company—start job hunting.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Software Engineer at Scale-Up (Successful)

**Context**: Rachel was a mid-level software engineer at a Series B startup for 18 months. Hired at $110k, she'd seen peer offers on Levels.fyi in the $130-145k range. She'd taken on tech lead responsibilities for her team (originally wasn't a lead), mentored two junior engineers, and led the architecture redesign of a core system.

**How they adapted it**: Rachel timed her ask for two weeks after the successful launch of the architecture redesign she'd led, which reduced server costs by 30% ($200k/year savings). She pre-wired her manager a month before: "I've been thinking about growth here. What would it take to get to senior engineer?" Her manager said "leading complex technical projects and mentoring others"—which she was already doing. In her formal ask, she requested $135k (splitting the difference between her current and top of market), framed it as both a market adjustment and recognition of her expanded scope into tech lead territory. She came with Levels.fyi data showing $130-145k was standard for senior engineers at Series B companies in her city.

**Result**: Manager came back in 10 days with $130k and a promotion to senior engineer (which had been her real goal—the title mattered for future job searches). She accepted. Key moves: timing after a big win, pre-wiring to understand what criteria mattered, bringing both scope expansion and market data, and being willing to accept $130k when she asked for $135k.

### Example 2: Marketing Manager at Agency (Rejected, Then Left)

**Context**: David was a marketing manager at a mid-size agency for three years. Started at $65k, got standard 3% raises to $69k. Knew he was significantly underpaid—market rate was $85-95k for his experience and role. He managed $2M in client budgets and had expanded from managing accounts to developing strategy and leading pitches for new business.

**How they adapted it**: David asked during his annual review for $85k, citing his expanded scope (now doing director-level work) and market data from three salary surveys. His manager's response: "That's not in our budget. Our bands for managers are $60-75k. If you want more, you'd need to make partner, which won't happen for at least 3-5 years." David asked "What would it take to get a market adjustment to at least $75k given the scope I'm handling?" Manager: "I can try for $72k next year but can't promise anything." No specific timeline, no real advocacy.

**Result**: David started job hunting immediately while staying professional. Within three months, had an offer for $90k at a competitor. Gave notice. Old company countered with $80k and a promise of partner track. He declined—didn't trust them given how the raise conversation went. Key lesson: A bad response to a reasonable raise request tells you about the company culture. Sometimes the win is clarity that you need to leave.

### Example 3: Product Designer at Enterprise (Partially Successful)

**Context**: Maria was a product designer at a large enterprise tech company for two years. Making $95k, market rate was $110-120k. She'd led the design system overhaul that was now being adopted across the company and was regularly doing design reviews for other teams (not part of her job description).

**How they adapted it**: Maria asked for $115k. Her manager's response: "I agree you deserve it, but we're in a promotion freeze right now because of budget. I can get you approved for $105k as a market adjustment, but getting you to $115k would require a promotion to senior designer, which I can't do until the freeze lifts—probably 6-8 months." Maria negotiated: "Can we do $105k now with a written commitment to revisit the senior promotion in 8 months when the freeze lifts? I want to make sure this doesn't get lost." Manager agreed and put it in writing.

**Result**: Got $105k immediately (10% raise), and 8 months later got promoted to senior designer with another bump to $118k. Total increase over 8 months: 24%. Key move: accepting a partial win now with documented commitment for next step later. Getting the "revisit in 8 months" in writing meant it actually happened.

## Common Problems and Fixes

### Problem: "They said yes but the paperwork has been 'in process' for 6 weeks"

**Why it happens**: Your manager is either not prioritizing it, doesn't actually have the authority they claimed, or the approval chain is genuinely slow. Sometimes they're hoping you'll forget or get impatient and quit.

**Quick fix**: Send weekly status update requests via email (creates paper trail): "Hi [Manager], checking in on the compensation adjustment we discussed. What's the current status and what's the blocker?" After 4 weeks with no concrete progress, escalate: "I want to make sure this doesn't fall through the cracks. Should I follow up with HR directly or is there someone else I should connect with?"

**Long-term solution**: Next time, get specific approval timelines upfront: "What's the typical timeline for this kind of approval? What are the steps between your approval and it showing up in my paycheck?" If it's going to take 8 weeks, at least you know.

### Problem: "I asked and got rejected but I can't afford to quit"

**Why it happens**: You're financially dependent on this job, they know it, and they called your bluff. Or the rejection was legitimate (no budget, recent raise, etc.) but you're stuck.

**Quick fix**: Accept the rejection gracefully and ask for a specific path forward: "I understand. What would it take for this to be approved in 6-12 months? What milestones would I need to hit?" Document their answer. Then quietly build your emergency fund and update your resume.

**Long-term solution**: Never negotiate from financial desperation. Build 6-12 months expenses saved before asking for raises. The best negotiating position is genuine ability to walk away. If you can't walk away, you're asking for a favor, not negotiating.

### Problem: "My manager is supportive but HR blocked it"

**Why it happens**: Sometimes true—HR has rigid bands and won't approve out-of-band requests. Sometimes this is your manager deflecting blame and they didn't actually advocate hard.

**Quick fix**: Ask to be part of the conversation: "I appreciate you advocating for me. Would it help if I spoke to HR directly to explain my scope expansion and market research? Or can you help me understand what HR's specific concern is so we can address it?"

**Long-term solution**: Research whether this is common at your company. If HR consistently blocks reasonable requests, that's a company culture problem and you should job hunt. If your manager consistently blames HR for their own lack of advocacy, that's a manager problem—consider internal transfer or leaving.

### Problem: "I got the raise but now I'm 'that person who negotiates'"

**Why it happens**: Some companies (and managers) have toxic cultures where asking for market-rate pay is seen as disloyalty. This is most common at startups that exploit "we're a family" culture and non-profits.

**Quick fix**: Continue being excellent at your job. Prove the raise was deserved through continued performance. The best response to this reputation is results.

**Long-term solution**: Update your resume and start taking recruiter calls. A company that penalizes you for asking for fair pay is not a company you want to build a career at. Get your money and plan your exit on your terms.

### Problem: "I'm worried asking will make them realize they should replace me with someone cheaper"

**Why it happens**: This fear is usually paranoia, but it's occasionally real at dysfunctional companies. If you're significantly underpaid, they know it—they're already choosing not to fix it. Asking doesn't change that calculation.

**Quick fix**: Before asking, make yourself harder to replace. Document your knowledge, train backups (shows you're a team player), but maintain specialized knowledge that would be painful to lose. Also check your performance record—if you're actually underperforming, fix that before asking for more money.

**Long-term solution**: If you work somewhere where asking for fair pay makes you a target, you work somewhere broken. Find a better company. Companies that value employees don't retaliate against people asking for market rate.

## The Minimal Viable Version

**If you need to ask this month**: Skip extensive documentation and research. Focus on Steps 1, 4, 7. Know your market rate (spend 3 hours researching), pick good timing (right after a win), and deliver a simple version of the pitch focusing on market data. "I've been here [time], I'm currently making [amount], market rate is [amount] based on [source], I'd like to discuss bringing my compensation to [specific number]."

**If you have zero leverage**: Don't ask for a raise. Ask for a clear path to one: "What would it take for me to earn a 15-20% increase in the next 12 months? What metrics would I need to hit?" Get their answer, document it, hit those metrics, then ask.

**If your company only does raises during annual reviews**: Don't fight the system. Use the off-cycle time to build your case, document everything, and prepare. Then make your pitch during the review cycle when budgets are being allocated.

**If you just want to test the waters**: Use Step 5 (pre-wiring) without making a formal ask yet. "I've been thinking about career growth and compensation. What does advancement look like from my current role?" Their response tells you whether this company rewards performance or tenure, and whether your manager will advocate for you.

## Advanced Optimizations

### Optimization 1: Get a competing offer (use carefully)

**When to add this**: If you've asked once, been rejected or lowballed, and you have 6+ months left of goodwill at current company

**How to implement**: Interview elsewhere and get a written offer. Don't accept it yet. Go to your manager: "I wasn't actively looking, but I was approached with an offer for [amount]. I like it here and want to stay, but I need to make sure my compensation reflects my market value. Can we discuss matching or getting close?" Only do this if you're genuinely willing to leave if they don't match. Never bluff with fake offers.

**Expected improvement**: This often works when normal asks don't because it provides external validation that you're underpaid and creates urgency (they might lose you). Risk: some companies have "no counter-offer" policies and will let you walk. Only use if willing to actually leave.

### Optimization 2: Negotiate total comp, not just salary

**When to add this**: If they can't/won't move on base salary

**How to implement**: When they say salary is fixed, shift to other components: "I understand the salary band is firm. Can we discuss equity refresh/stock grants, sign-on bonus, additional vacation days, professional development budget, or remote work flexibility?" Sometimes there's more flexibility in non-salary comp.

**Expected improvement**: You might not get the base salary you want, but you get total comp closer to your target. $5k in extra equity or $2k professional development budget is real value even if base doesn't move.

### Optimization 3: Build a raise coalition

**When to add this**: If you know multiple coworkers are also underpaid

**How to implement**: Carefully discuss compensation with trusted peers (know your company's policies—some prohibit this, which is illegal in many jurisdictions). If multiple people are underpaid, approach management as a group or time your individual asks closely. "I know several people on the team have been researching market rates and we're all seeing similar gaps" is harder to dismiss than one person asking.

**Expected improvement**: Harder for management to dismiss as individual grievance. Creates urgency if they worry about losing multiple people. Risk: requires high trust with coworkers and good company culture. Don't try this at toxic companies.

## What to Do When It Stops Working

Sometimes your company genuinely can't or won't pay you fairly. Knowing when to stop negotiating and start leaving is crucial.

**How to know it's broken versus just harder**: If you've asked twice (at least 12 months apart), with strong cases both times, and gotten either rejections or token 3% increases while knowing you're 20%+ underpaid, the company won't fix this. If your manager says they agree but can't get approval, and this happens twice, either they lack the influence to advocate for you or they're not actually trying.

**When to try one more time**: If external circumstances change (new funding, acquisition, new leadership, company announces they're addressing compensation gaps, you get promoted), you have justification for another ask. Lead with "I know we discussed this [timeframe] ago. Given [changed circumstance], I wanted to revisit."

**When to stop asking and start leaving**: If you're getting market-rate offers elsewhere that are 20%+ higher and your company won't match after you've asked twice. If asking for raises has resulted in being labeled "difficult" or you've been subtly deprioritized. If the company culture treats asking for fair pay as disloyalty. Any of these mean the problem isn't your negotiation tactics—it's the company.

**How to leave professionally after a rejected raise**: Give standard notice, don't burn bridges, don't tell everyone the real reason you're leaving. In your exit interview, you can mention compensation was a factor but don't rant. Your reputation follows you—leave gracefully even when you're angry.

The hardest truth: some companies systematically underpay and rely on people being too afraid or uncomfortable to ask, and then churn through employees when they eventually leave. If you work at one of these companies, the winning move isn't better negotiation tactics. It's leaving.

## Tools and Resources

**Essential**:
- **Levels.fyi**: Best for tech roles. Free. Shows base salary, stock, bonus breakdown by company, level, and location.
- **Glassdoor**: Broader industry coverage. Free but less detailed than Levels.fyi.
- **Payscale or Salary.com**: Good for non-tech roles. Free basic reports, $30-50 for detailed reports.

**Optional but helpful**:
- **Blind**: Anonymous professional network where people discuss real compensation. Free. Good reality check on whether your company pays fairly.
- **Robert Half or Hays salary guides**: Annual salary surveys by industry. Free PDFs. Good for establishing industry-wide baseline.
- **Professional association salary surveys**: Many industries have annual member surveys. Usually free for members ($50-200 membership).

**Free resources**:
- **Raise request template**: [Script from Step 7 adapted to your situation]
- **Compensation research tracker**: [Spreadsheet to organize data from multiple sources]
- **Impact documentation template**: [Document listing responsibilities, projects, outcomes with dates]
- **Negotiation objection handler**: [List of common objections with your prepared responses]

## The Takeaway

Asking for a raise isn't asking for a favor—it's updating your compensation to reflect your current value. Companies will pay you the minimum you'll accept unless you force the conversation. Waiting for them to proactively fix your underpayment is waiting for something that almost never happens.

The single most important step is Step 1: know your actual market value with specific data. "I feel underpaid" fails. "I'm making $85k and market rate is $110-130k based on data from Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and two recruiters" forces a real conversation. The second most important is Step 10: deciding your next move based on outcome. If they say no and you accept it without a plan, you've just taught them you won't leave even when underpaid.

The next action: Open Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, or your industry's salary survey right now. Spend 30 minutes researching what your role actually pays. Write down the range. If you're more than 10% below the middle of that range, you're underpaid and you have a case. If you're 20%+ below, you're significantly underpaid and you need to either ask or start job hunting. Don't wait for perfect timing—the best time to ask was six months ago, the second best time is now.
