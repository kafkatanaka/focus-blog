You've made it forty minutes into the two-hour client presentation. Your camera is on, you're nodding at appropriate intervals, but you have no idea what the last five slides said. You're clicking between tabs, half-writing an email, fully aware that if someone asks you a direct question right now you'll be exposed. You tried taking notes. You tried closing all other windows. You tried coffee. None of it works past the 30-minute mark, and you have three more of these calls this week.

Here's how to actually stay present.

**Video calls drain focus faster than in-person meetings because your brain is processing two realities simultaneously—the meeting content and your own video performance—while sitting in an environment full of alternative dopamine sources.**

## Why Long Video Calls Feel So Hard

A 90-minute video call requires more cognitive energy than a 3-hour in-person meeting. Your brain is doing four jobs at once: processing information, monitoring your own face and body language, suppressing your environment (the laundry, your phone, the fridge), and managing the artificial social dynamics of grid view where you can see everyone watching everyone else.

The attention cost compounds over time. Minutes 1-20, you're mostly fine. Minutes 20-45, you're fighting distraction but still catching most content. After 45 minutes, your prefrontal cortex—the part that maintains focus—is depleted. You're running on fumes. By minute 75, you're not really in the meeting anymore. You're performing "being in a meeting" while your brain does anything else.

The physical setup makes it worse. In a conference room, moving around is normal. On video, you're locked in a 2x2 foot frame. Your body wants to shift, stand, pace, or leave—normal attention regulation tools—but the camera makes all of that weird. So you sit still, which signals to your brain that nothing is happening, which makes focus even harder.

### The mistake most guides make

Most video call focus advice treats the problem like you're distracted by social media or email. "Close your tabs! Turn off notifications! Be more disciplined!" But you're not losing focus because Reddit is tempting. You're losing focus because sustained attention on video is neurologically expensive, your environment actively works against you, and most meetings genuinely don't require your full attention for the full duration.

The guides also assume you control the meeting structure. They'll say "keep meetings to 30 minutes" or "build in breaks." That works if you're running the meeting. It fails completely when you're the junior person on a client call, the IC in an executive planning session, or anyone in a meeting culture that treats back-to-back video as normal.

## What You'll Need

**Time investment**: 45 minutes setup, 10 minutes pre-meeting prep, 5 minutes post-meeting reset  
**Upfront cost**: $0-$40 (standing desk converter optional but helpful)  
**Prerequisites**: Control over your physical environment during calls, ability to have camera off occasionally or use a static background, meetings where active participation is intermittent  
**Won't work if**: You're presenting for 90% of the call, you're in high-stakes sales/client meetings with zero tolerance for visible distraction, your company monitors screen activity, you're actively fighting ADHD without medication/support

## The Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Environmental Setup and Baseline (Week 1)

**Step 1: Map Your Actual Attention Pattern**

- What to do: For the next 5 video calls, track your focus in real-time. Open a simple note and timestamp when you feel fully present vs when you zone out. Don't try to fix anything yet—just observe. Note: time into call, topic at that moment, what pulled you away (if anything), how long until you re-engaged.
- Why it matters: Most people think they lose focus randomly. You don't. There's a pattern. You might zone out during status updates but stay sharp during decisions. You might last 60 minutes in morning calls but only 25 in afternoon calls. You can't fix focus until you know your actual baseline.
- Common mistake: Tracking only the calls where you struggled. Track easy calls too. The contrast reveals what conditions help versus hurt.
- Quick check: You should have at least 15 timestamps across 5 calls. If you have fewer than that, you either didn't zone out (unlikely) or you zoned out so hard you forgot to track (more likely—try setting a phone timer for every 20 minutes as a tracking reminder).

**Step 2: Build a Focus-Friendly Physical Space**

- What to do: Eliminate choice from your video call space. Before calls: (1) Close all browser tabs except meeting link and one notes document, (2) Put phone in different room on silent (not just face-down, actually gone), (3) Position your camera so your screen is not visible to others (prevents performance anxiety about your tabs), (4) Put a water bottle in reach so "getting water" isn't an excuse to break focus.
- Why it matters: Willpower doesn't work. Every visible tab, every phone notification, every decision point depletes your focus budget. You have maybe 3 "resist distraction" moments before you cave. The solution isn't stronger willpower—it's fewer choice points.
- Common mistake: Putting phone face-down on desk. You'll still reach for it reflexively. Also, keeping "emergency" tabs open (Slack, email). There's no emergency that can't wait 90 minutes. If you're that critical, you shouldn't be in a 90-minute meeting anyway.
- Quick check: Sit in your video call space right now. Without moving, what could you reach or see that isn't meeting-essential? That needs to go.

**Step 3: Establish Your Movement Protocol**

- What to do: Test what movements work on camera. Try: standing (if desk allows), shifting side to side, leaning back, walking in place, fidget toy under desk. See what feels natural and doesn't look weird on screen. Pick 2-3 that work. Write them down. These are your "focus reset" moves.
- Why it matters: Sitting perfectly still for 90 minutes is unnatural. Your body interprets stillness as sleep time or threat response—either way, not "pay attention" time. Movement signals engagement to your brain. But random movement looks unprofessional, so you need pre-approved moves.
- Common mistake: Waiting until you're already zoned out to move. By then, the movement feels disruptive and weird. Instead, use movement proactively—shift position every 15 minutes whether you need it or not.
- Quick check: Record yourself doing each movement. Watch it back. Does it look like "engaged participant" or "bored person fidgeting"? Adjust until it reads right.

**Checkpoint**: You should now know when you typically lose focus, have a distraction-free space, and know what movements work for you on camera. If your attention pattern shows you can't stay focused past 30 minutes regardless of topic, the problem isn't technique—it's meeting structure, and you need to advocate for breaks or different formats.

### Phase 2: Active Focus Management During Calls (Week 2-4)

**Step 4: Use Structured Note-Taking (Not Performance Note-Taking)**

- What to do: Create a meeting doc with three sections before every call: DECISIONS (what was decided), ACTIONS (who does what by when), QUESTIONS (what you need to ask). During the call, write only these—nothing else. When your mind wanders, read what you've captured so far. This pulls you back in without requiring you to process new information.
- Why it matters: Most people take notes to look engaged or to capture everything. Both approaches fail. Performance notes are exhausting (you're writing, not listening). Transcript notes are impossible (you can't capture everything and stay present). Decision/Action/Question notes keep you engaged with what actually matters.
- Common mistake: Writing down everything the speaker says word-for-word. This is passive transcription, not active engagement. Your hand is busy but your brain is off. Only write what changes or requires followup.
- Quick check: Look at your notes from your last long meeting. If they're more than 15 bullets for a 60-minute call, you're over-capturing. Aim for 5-8 bullets maximum.

**Step 5: Build in Micro-Recoveries Every 20 Minutes**

- What to do: Set a silent timer (phone in other room, use watch or computer) for 20 minutes. When it goes off, take a 60-second micro-break: camera stays on, audio stays on, but you look away from screen. Stretch, close eyes, look out window, take 3 deep breaths. Then refocus. Repeat every 20 minutes.
- Why it matters: Your brain's attention span is 15-25 minutes for sustained focus. After that, you're using effort to stay present, and effort depletes. A 60-second break resets the attention clock. You'll catch more in minutes 21-40 than if you white-knuckle through without breaks.
- Common mistake: Waiting until you feel zoned out to break. By then, you've already lost 5-10 minutes of content. The break is preventive, not reactive. Also, taking 5+ minute breaks—this completely removes you from the meeting flow and makes re-entry harder.
- Quick check: Your 60-second break should feel too short. If it feels like enough time, you're taking longer than 60 seconds or your attention wasn't actually depleted yet.

**Step 6: Create Active Participation Triggers**

- What to do: Identify 2-3 moments in every meeting where you will speak, even if just to agree or ask a clarifying question. Set these as intentions before the call: "I'll ask one question in the first 30 minutes, make one comment about [topic], and confirm action items at the end." Write these down where you can see them.
- Why it matters: Passive listening is exponentially harder than active participation. When you speak, even briefly, you're forced to synthesize information and engage. The act of speaking—not what you say—pulls you into focus. Plus, knowing you'll need to speak creates a low-grade accountability that keeps you tracking content.
- Common mistake: Waiting to speak only when you have something brilliant to contribute. This is setting yourself up for silence. Instead, plan to speak at specific times regardless of whether it feels necessary. "Just to confirm, we're saying [X]?" is enough.
- Quick check: If you attended a 60-minute call and spoke zero times, you weren't engaged—you were watching. Aim for 3+ verbal contributions per hour minimum.

**Step 7: Match Your Energy to Meeting Timing**

- What to do: Schedule high-stakes or complex calls during your peak focus hours (for most people: 9am-12pm or just after lunch). Put low-stakes/passive calls (all-hands, info-sharing) during your low-energy slots (usually 2-4pm). If you can't control scheduling, front-load your focus tasks on days with afternoon video marathons.
- Why it matters: Fighting your natural energy rhythm is possible for one call. It's not sustainable for a full day. A 10am strategy call might require zero extra effort to stay focused. The same call at 3pm might require heroic effort and still fail.
- Common mistake: Accepting all meeting times equally because "I should be able to focus anytime." You can't. No one can. Your brain has high-tide and low-tide hours. Schedule around them or accept that some calls will be harder.
- Quick check: Look at your calendar for next week. Are your most demanding calls clustered in your low-energy windows? If yes, try to move at least one. If you can't move any, that's a structural problem worth flagging to your manager.

**What to expect**: Weeks 2-3, this will feel like a lot of process. You'll forget your timer, skip micro-breaks, fall back into passive listening. That's normal. By week 4, the structure becomes automatic and requires less active management.

**Don't panic if**: You zone out completely during one call despite using all techniques. Could be you slept badly, the topic was genuinely irrelevant to your role, or the meeting was poorly run. One failure doesn't mean the system is broken. Three failures in a row means something needs adjustment.

### Phase 3: Sustainable Maintenance and Boundary-Setting (Month 2+)

**Step 8: Implement the "Active When Relevant" Protocol**

- What to do: At the start of longer calls (90+ minutes), identify your relevant segments. Before the call, ask the organizer: "What sections will need my input?" Then: full focus during your segments, minimum viable presence during others. During non-relevant segments, camera on but you're allowed to do low-cognitive tasks (filing emails, light admin). When your segment comes, full attention returns.
- Why it matters: Most long calls don't require your full attention for the full time. Pretending otherwise leads to burnout and resentment. Giving yourself permission to partially attend the irrelevant parts preserves energy for when you actually need to contribute.
- Common mistake: Multitasking during your relevant segments. This protocol only works if you can actually snap back to full focus when needed. If you can't reliably do that, you need full focus the whole time or you shouldn't be in the meeting.
- Quick check: After a long call using this protocol, you should be able to answer detailed questions about your segments and general questions about other segments. If someone asks "What did Sarah decide about Q3 goals?" and you have no idea, you were too checked out.

**Step 9: Develop Your Meeting Decline Criteria**

- What to do: Create a written rule for what meetings you'll attend versus decline or send summary. Example criteria: "I attend if (1) I'm making a decision, (2) I'm presenting, or (3) the outcome directly affects my current project. Otherwise I request async update." Apply this rule for 2 weeks and track: How many meetings dropped? Did you miss anything critical?
- Why it matters: The best way to maintain focus during long video calls is to be in fewer long video calls. Most people attend meetings out of FOMO or unclear norms, not actual necessity. Every unnecessary meeting trains your brain that meetings don't matter, which makes focusing in necessary meetings harder.
- Common mistake: Applying decline criteria only to meetings you already wanted to skip. That's just confirmation bias. Apply it consistently, including to meetings you're curious about or where you want to be helpful. If it doesn't meet criteria, you decline.
- Quick check: If you declined zero meetings in 2 weeks, your criteria are too loose or you're not actually applying them. Aim to decline or async-attend 20-30% of meeting invites.

**Step 10: Build the After-Call Reset Ritual**

- What to do: After every video call over 60 minutes, take a 10-minute hard break before any other focused work. Leave your desk. Go outside if possible, or at least to a different room. No screens. Physical movement required. This isn't optional—it's recovery time.
- Why it matters: Video call fatigue is real and cumulative. Going straight from a 90-minute call into deep work or another call is running a marathon then immediately starting a sprint. Your performance crashes, and you feel exhausted by 2pm. The 10-minute reset prevents cascade failure.
- Common mistake: Treating the break as phone-scrolling time. This is still screen time and doesn't reset your nervous system. Also, skipping breaks when you "don't feel tired." The fatigue is happening at a physiological level whether you feel it consciously or not.
- Quick check: Block these breaks on your calendar as "Focus Recovery" or something similar. If you skip them twice in one week, your schedule is too tight and something else needs to give.

**Signs it's working**: You can summarize key points from 90-minute calls, you're not exhausted by 3pm on heavy meeting days, you speak up at least 3 times per hour-long call, your notes are useful later (not just meeting theater).

**Red flags**: You're multitasking during parts where you later needed the information, you're declining meetings that do affect your work, you feel resentful about every meeting invite, you need caffeine to survive calls that should be straightforward.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Product manager, back-to-back calls 9am-4pm, open floor plan at home
**Context**: James has 4-6 video calls daily, each 60-90 minutes. His partner also works from home in the next room. He tried noise-canceling headphones but still heard her calls. He was taking notes frantically in every meeting, ending each day with pages of notes he never read. By 2pm daily, he couldn't process new information—just nodding along and hoping no one asked him direct questions.

**How they adapted it**: Created a rotation with his partner: morning person gets the quiet room for focus work, afternoon person gets it for calls (they swap daily). This meant James sometimes took calls from the bedroom or kitchen—he accepted that "professional background" wasn't possible and used Zoom's background blur. Stopped taking transcript notes; switched to DECISIONS/ACTIONS/QUESTIONS only. Started blocking 15-minute "reset" breaks between back-to-backs, marked as "Focus Recovery" on shared calendar.

**Result**: Went from retaining maybe 40% of call content to 75%+. 2pm slump still exists but isn't a complete crash. His notes dropped from 2-3 pages per call to 8-10 bullets, but those bullets are actually useful. Partner relationship improved (fewer "Why are you in my call background?" fights).

### Example 2: Junior associate, client calls where speaking up is risky, ADHD
**Context**: Maria has ADHD and struggles with long passive listening. Most of her calls are client presentations led by senior staff where juniors are expected to be present but quiet unless directly asked. She'd lose focus by minute 20, panic about missing something important, then over-focus on note-taking to compensate (which meant not listening at all).

**How they adapted it**: Got permission to keep camera off for portions of calls (framed as "technical issues"). Used those portions to stand, pace, and do one-handed fidgeting with a silent fidget cube. For critical segments, camera back on and she'd intentionally ask one clarifying question to force engagement. Started taking prescribed ADHD medication 45 minutes before long calls specifically (worked with doctor on timing).

**Result**: Can now handle 90-minute client calls without complete focus collapse. Still struggles past 2 hours—but communicated this to her manager, who now tries to rotate her out of 2+ hour calls when possible. Notes are better because she's actually listening instead of transcribing. Anxiety about "being caught" zoning out decreased significantly.

### Example 3: Engineering manager, presenting to executives, high performance pressure
**Context**: Dev presented monthly to C-suite on technical roadmaps—90-minute calls where they'd present for 30 minutes then field questions for 60. The pressure made them hyper-focus during their presentation but completely crash during others' segments. They'd still be on camera, still expected to potentially answer questions, but completely unable to track the conversation after their section ended.

**How they adapted it**: Started booking the conference room for these calls even though everyone was remote (being physically "at work" helped mental state). Created a one-page reference sheet with likely questions and answers to their section—having this visible reduced anxiety. During others' sections, used "Active When Relevant" protocol: they tracked decisions that affected their team, but gave themselves permission to zone out on unrelated segments. Used the chat to stay minimally engaged ("Great point about Q3 timeline") without requiring full presence.

**Result**: Post-presentation crash still happens but is less severe. Executives haven't noticed any difference in Dev's engagement (turns out they weren't expecting full attention on every topic anyway). Dev now ends these calls tired but functional, not completely depleted. Started advocating for written summaries instead of requiring engineering presence at all-company meetings.

## Common Problems and Fixes

### Problem: "I zone out and suddenly realize I missed 10 minutes"
**Why it happens**: Your brain entered a microsleep or default mode network state—totally normal physiological response to sustained attention without sufficient stimulation or breaks.
**Quick fix**: The moment you notice you've zoned out, ask a question. Anything. "Sorry, could you repeat the last decision point?" or "Just to clarify, are we saying [thing you do remember]?" This forces re-engagement and usually no one realizes you zoned out.
**Long-term solution**: Your 20-minute break timer isn't working. Either you're ignoring it or 20 minutes is too long for you. Try 15-minute intervals. Also check: Are you getting enough sleep? 7+ hours is non-negotiable for sustained focus.

### Problem: "My camera is on and I can't move around without looking weird"
**Why it happens**: You're treating video like a performance instead of a tool. Also, you might have your camera positioned badly—if people see your whole torso, movement is more obvious than if they see just your head/shoulders.
**Quick fix**: Raise your camera angle so the frame cuts you off mid-chest. This allows shoulder/torso movement without it being obvious. Also, everyone else is looking at the speaker or their own face—they're not scrutinizing your movements as much as you think.
**Long-term solution**: Normalize movement in your company's video culture. Senior person? Start shifting/standing in calls. Others will follow. Junior person? Ask your manager: "Is it okay if I stand during long calls?" Odds are high they'll say yes. If they say no, that's useful information about your company's dysfunction.

### Problem: "I can stay focused in morning calls but completely fail in afternoon calls"
**Why it happens**: Decision fatigue and ego depletion. By 2pm, you've made hundreds of micro-decisions. Your prefrontal cortex is exhausted. This is biology, not a willpower failure.
**Quick fix**: For afternoon calls specifically, do the "Active When Relevant" protocol—save full focus only for your critical segments. For the rest, minimum viable presence is fine.
**Long-term solution**: Rearrange your schedule so focused work happens in the morning, video calls happen in the afternoon. If that's impossible, block 30-60 minutes before afternoon calls for genuine rest (not email, not Slack—actual downtime). Eat protein-heavy lunch, not carbs (blood sugar crashes make afternoon focus worse).

### Problem: "I'm supposed to be taking notes but note-taking prevents me from listening"
**Why it happens**: You can't fully engage two language processing tasks simultaneously. Speaking/listening and writing both use the same neural pathways. When you write, you're not listening. When you listen, you're not writing.
**Quick fix**: Switch to DECISIONS/ACTIONS/QUESTIONS method. Only write when someone says something that fits these categories. Otherwise, just listen. If it's important, it'll fit one of these three.
**Long-term solution**: Record calls (with permission) so you can review later instead of capturing everything live. Or, rotate note-taking responsibility—one person takes notes, everyone else can fully listen. Most companies that require note-taking don't actually need detailed notes; they need the appearance of diligence.

### Problem: "The meeting is genuinely boring and irrelevant to my role"
**Why it happens**: It is boring and irrelevant. You're right. The question isn't how to focus better—it's why you're in this meeting.
**Quick fix**: Before the next instance of this recurring meeting, email the organizer: "What sections require my input? I want to make sure I'm fully present when needed." This signals you're considering partial attendance.
**Long-term solution**: Decline the meeting or request async updates. Use language like: "To give my full attention to [other priority], I'd like to get async summaries of [this meeting]. I'm happy to join for specific sections if needed." Most managers will respect this if you frame it as protecting your focus for higher-priority work.

### Problem: "I need to multitask during calls to keep up with my other work"
**Why it happens**: You have too much work, not a focus problem. If the only way you can complete your work is to multitask during meetings, your workload is unsustainable.
**Quick fix**: Accept that you cannot do both. Either actually attend the meeting (full focus, no multitasking) or decline and do your other work. Half-attending helps no one and guarantees you'll miss something important.
**Long-term solution**: This is a capacity conversation with your manager. "I have 20 hours of meetings weekly and 30 hours of deep work needed. These don't fit in a 40-hour week. What should I deprioritize?" If they say nothing, you have a workload problem that focus techniques can't solve.

### Problem: "I'm in all-day video training/workshops and losing it by hour 3"
**Why it happens**: All-day video sessions are developmentally inappropriate for adult learning. In-person workshops work because you move, there's social accountability, environment changes. Video removes all of those focus supports.
**Quick fix**: Advocate for breaks. "I'm noticing energy dropping around 11am—would it help the group to take a 10-minute break?" You'll be a hero; everyone else is dying too.
**Long-term solution**: Push back on all-day video formats. Propose async learning with short sync check-ins. Or, hybrid: morning video session, afternoon async work, next-day Q&A video session. If you're not in a position to advocate, treat all-day video days as recovery days the next day—don't schedule anything demanding.

## The Minimal Viable Version

**If you only have 30 minutes**: Clear your desk before calls, put phone in another room, set a 20-minute timer for micro-breaks. That's it. This handles 70% of the problem.

**If you only have $0**: Use free tools you already have. Phone timer, basic notepad, browser tab management. Standing instead of sitting requires $0. Looking away from screen for 60 seconds requires $0.

**If you only have weekends**: Set up your physical space once on Sunday (clear desk, position camera, test standing setup). Create a meeting note template you can copy before each call. Review your calendar Friday afternoon and identify which meetings need full focus versus partial.

**If you have ADHD**: Medication timing matters—take it 45-60 minutes before your longest calls. Use fidget tools under desk (silent ones only). Camera off when possible. Accept that you need more breaks than neurotypical people—that's accommodation, not weakness. Consider requesting agenda items in advance so you can prepare specific attention triggers.

**If you're in back-to-back calls all day**: You cannot maintain high-quality focus for 6+ hours of video. Accept this. Build a rhythm: full focus call, partial focus call, full focus call, partial focus call. Block 10-minute breaks between all back-to-backs (mark as "Focus Recovery" so people can't book them). If you can't block breaks, decline every other meeting.

## Advanced Optimizations

### Optimization 1: Strategic Camera Usage
**When to add this**: After 2-3 weeks of successful basic protocol, if you're still struggling with specific meeting types
**How to implement**: Map your meetings into tiers. Tier 1 (client-facing, presentations): Camera required, full focus techniques. Tier 2 (internal team syncs): Camera on but you can use "Active When Relevant." Tier 3 (all-hands, info-sharing): Camera off allowed, minimum viable presence. Get explicit permission from your manager for this tiering—most will support it if you frame it as energy management for better performance.
**Expected improvement**: 25-40% reduction in video fatigue. You're using your limited camera-on energy for meetings where it matters most.

### Optimization 2: Meeting Note Sharing System
**When to add this**: Once you've mastered DECISIONS/ACTIONS/QUESTIONS note-taking for yourself
**How to implement**: Volunteer to share notes after meetings (or rotate with teammates). This creates external accountability—you can't zone out if you're responsible for the summary. Use a template: paste it into chat at end of call, everyone can add/correct. Takes 3 extra minutes, keeps you engaged the full call.
**Expected improvement**: Accountability dramatically increases focus quality. Plus, you become known as "the person who actually pays attention," which has career benefits.

### Optimization 3: Walking Meeting Protocol
**When to add this**: For recurring 1:1s or small-group calls where you're not presenting
**How to implement**: Get a phone armband or pocket setup. Tell the other person: "I'm going to walk for this call—better for my focus." Put in earbuds, go outside or walk around your home. Audio-only, moving. You'll be more present than sitting still on video.
**Expected improvement**: Walking increases cognitive function and attention span. 1:1s can go 60+ minutes with sustained focus using this method. Only works for calls where you don't need to see screen-sharing or be on camera.

## What to Do When It Stops Working

The system breaks down in three predictable ways: your environment changed, meeting culture changed, or you're experiencing actual burnout.

**Environment changed**: New office setup, new roommate, different home situation. Your previous focus infrastructure doesn't fit. Re-do Phase 1, Step 2—build focus-friendly space for your new environment. Don't try to force the old system; adapt to new constraints.

**Meeting culture changed**: New job, new manager, new team norms. What worked at your old company doesn't fly here. Observe for 2 weeks: What do successful people in this culture do during long calls? Match that. If the culture is "cameras on, full attention, always," you need meeting decline criteria more than focus techniques.

**Actual burnout**: You're exhausted before calls even start, resentful of every meeting invite, can't recover energy between calls. This isn't a focus problem—it's a capacity problem. The fix isn't better techniques; it's fewer meetings or time off. Red flag test: If you feel relief when a meeting gets canceled (not just neutral, but actual relief), you're over capacity.

**How to know it's broken vs just harder**: Broken = you're using all techniques and still can't track basic information, or you're skipping techniques because they feel like too much effort. Harder = techniques work but require conscious application. If it's just harder, keep going—that's normal. If it's broken, stop and diagnose: environment, culture, or burnout?

**When to restart**: After addressing root cause. New environment? Once space is set up. Culture issue? Once you've clarified norms with your manager. Burnout? After at least one week of actual vacation (not working vacation). Trying to restart before fixing root cause just means repeating the same failure.

## Tools and Resources

**Essential**:
- **Timer** (phone, watch, or browser extension): Free. Critical for 20-minute micro-breaks. Use Pomofocus.io if you want browser-based, or just your phone timer.
- **Note template**: Free. Create once, copy before every meeting. Google Doc, Notion, or plain text file. Format: DECISIONS / ACTIONS / QUESTIONS.

**Optional but helpful**:
- **Standing desk converter**: $30-$150. Makes movement during calls natural. VIVO brand on Amazon has good $40 options. Or, put laptop on books/boxes—free standing desk.
- **Blue light filtering glasses**: $15-$30. Reduces eye strain during back-to-back video. Felix Gray or Peepers brands. Only matters if you're doing 4+ hours of video daily.
- **Quality headset with mute button**: $50-$100. Being able to mute without fumbling for software button reduces cognitive load. Jabra Evolve2 40 is solid at $60.

**Free resources**:
- [Meeting note template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/EXAMPLE): Copy and customize. Includes DECISIONS/ACTIONS/QUESTIONS structure plus space for pre-meeting relevant segments identification.
- [Video call energy calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/EXAMPLE): Input your weekly meeting hours by type, get fatigue score and recommended breaks. Helps with meeting decline decisions.

## The Takeaway

You can't maintain peak focus for 90-minute video calls through sheer willpower—your brain isn't designed for it. The solution is environmental setup to remove choice points, 20-minute attention intervals with micro-recoveries, and honest assessment of which meetings require your full attention versus minimum viable presence. Most people can handle 2-3 hours of high-quality video focus daily; beyond that, you're in energy deficit territory that techniques can't fix.

The mistake is treating every video call as equally important and forcing full attention on all of them. The win is preserving your limited focus energy for meetings that actually matter, using structure to stay present when needed, and building recovery breaks into your schedule so you're not running on empty by 2pm.

**Do this today**: Track your focus for your next long video call. Note when you zone out, what pulls you back in, how long you stay present. That 90-minute observation tells you whether your problem is environmental, behavioral, or capacity-based—and which solutions will actually work.
