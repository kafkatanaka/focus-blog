        The Focus Dividend is about the compound returns of protecting your attention.
        Most productivity advice tells you to work harder or longer. But the people who get the most done aren't optimizing for hours—they're optimizing for focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site explores:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why focus is harder now than it used to be</li>
        <li>How distraction quietly erodes your work, money, and decisions</li>
        <li>What actually helps when motivation and discipline aren't enough</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's written for knowledge workers, remote professionals, and anyone who feels stuck between being busy and being effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        No hacks. No shortcuts. Just honest thinking about attention, work, and what's worth protecting.
